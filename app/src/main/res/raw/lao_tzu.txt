The flexible are preserved unbroken. The bent become straight. The empty are filled. The exhausted become renewed. The poor are enriched. The rich are confounded. Therefore the sage embraces the one. Because he doesn’t display himself, people can see his light. Because he has nothing to prove, people can trust his words. Because he doesn’t know who he is, people recognize themselves in him. Because he has no goal in mind, everything he does succeeds. The old saying that the flexible are preserved unbroken is surely right! If you have truly attained wholeness, everything will flock to you.

Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.

For Chuang Tzu, the truly great man is therefore not the man who has, by a lifetime of study and practice, accumulated a great fund of virtue and merit, but the man in whom "Tao acts without impediment," the "man of Tao." Several of the texts in this present book describe the "man of Tao." Others tell us what he is not. One of the most instructive, in this respect, is the long and delightful story of the anxiety-ridden, perfectionistic disciple of Keng Sang Chu, who is sent to Lao Tzu to learn the "elements." He is told that "if you persist in trying to attain what is never attained ... in reasoning about what cannot be understood, you will be destroyed.
--
Western scholars, contemptible in their pretentious and shallow scholarship, have translated Tao as Way. How foolish! Tao is Spirit, the Spirit that permeates all heaven and all earth, even those far beyond ours. Tao includes all that is not, and all that is; Lao Tzu describes it in these words.Silent, aloof, alone,It changes not, nor fails, but touches all.I do not know its name, One name for it is Tao.Pressed for designation,I call it  Tao.Tao means Outgoing,Outgoing, Far-reaching, Far-reaching, Return.

When the people of the world all know beauty as beauty, There arises the recognition of ugliness. When they all know the good as good, There arises the recognition of evil. -Lao Tzu, The Tao Te Ching
--
Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself? LAO-TZU, Tao-te-Ching
--
What is the Tao Te Ching? Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, a God-realized being named Lao-tzu in ancient China dictated 81 verses which are regarded by many as the ultimate commentary on the nature of existence.
--
They found security in letting go rather than in holding on and, in so doing, developed an attitude toward life that might be called psychophysical judo. Nearly twenty-five centuries ago, the Chinese sages Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu had called it wu-wei, which is perhaps best translated as "action without forcing." It is sailing in the stream of the Tao, or course of nature, and navigating the currents of li (organic pattern)-a word that originally signified the natural markings in jade or the grain in wood. As this attitude spread and prevailed in the wake of Vibration Training, people became more and more indulgent about eccentricity in life-style, tolerant of racial and religious differences, and adventurous in exploring unusual ways of loving.
--
Lao-tzu didn't actually say very much more about the meaning of Tao. The Way of Nature, the Way of happening self-so, or, if you like, the very process of life, was something which he was much too wise to define. For to try to say anything definite about the Tao is like trying to eat your mouth: you can't get outside it to chew it. To put it the other way round: anything you can chew is not your mouth.

Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.

If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading. 

--
If you correct your mind, the rest of your life will fall into place. 

--
The best fighter is never angry. 

--
At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are, and you know what you want. 

--
A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar. 

--
A man with outward courage dares to die: a man with inner courage dares to live. 

--
Be Content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you. 

--
Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner. 

--
Be the chief but never the lord. 

--
If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. if you are at peace, you are living in the present. 

--
Because of a great love, one is courageous. 

--
Stop thinking and end your problems. 

--
New beginnings are disguised as painful endings. 

--
By letting it go it all gets done. The world is won by those who let it go. But when you try and try. The world is beyond the winning. 

--
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, have few desires. 

--
Make your heart like a lake with a calm still surface and great depths of kindness. 

--
Do not look only at yourself, and you will see much. Do not justify yourself, and you will be distinguished. Do not brag, and you will have merit. Do not be prideful, and your work will endure. 

--
Great acts are made up of small deeds. 

--
Few things under heaven bring more benefit than the lessons learned from silence and the actions taken without striving. 

--
Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. 

--
He who is contented is rich. 

--
For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions. 

--
From caring comes courage. 

--
From wonder into wonder existence opens. 

--
The heart that gives, gathers. 

--
Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it. 

--
Confidence is the greatest friend. 

--
Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish 

--
Great indeed is the sublimity of the Creative, to which all beings owe their beginning, and which permeates all heaven. 

--
Wasting energy to obtain rare objects only impedes one’s growth. 

--
Be still like a mountain, and flow like a great river. 

--
Act without expectation. 

--
He who controls others may be powerful, but he who has mastered himself is mightier still. 

--
Use the light that is within you to revert to your natural clearness of sight. 

--
He who does not trust enough, Will not be trusted. 

--
Watch your thoughts, they become your words. Watch your words, they become your actions. Watch your actions, they become your habits. Watch your habits, they become your character. Watch your character, it becomes your destiny. 

--
He who knows himself is enlightened. 

--
To avoid disappointment, know what is sufficient. To avoid trouble, know when to stop. If you are able to do this, you will last a long time. 

--
Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it. 

--
He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know. 

--
Empty yourself of everything 

--
He who obtains has little. He who scatters has much. 

--
He who talks more is sooner exhausted. 

--
He, who rushes ahead, does not go far.He, who tries to shine, dims his own light.He, who defines himself, can’t know who he really is.He, who knows, does not speak. He, who speaks, does not know. 

--

Goodie-goodies are the thieves of virtue.

--

Life and death are one thread, the same line viewed from different sides.

--

Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend. Non-being is the greatest joy.

--

Thirty spokes meet in the hub,
but the empty space between them
is the essence of the wheel.

Pots are formed from clay,
but the empty space within it
is the essence of the pot.

Walls with windows and doors
form the house,
but the empty space within it
is the essence of the home.

--

Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.

--

Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.

--

He who conquers others is strong; He who conquers himself is mighty.

--

The wise man does not lay up his own treasures. The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own.

--

Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.

--

It is as though he listened and such listening as his enfolds us in silence in which at last we begin to hear what we are meant to be.

--

A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.

--

The very highest is barely known.
Then comes that which people know and love,
Then that which is feared,
Then that which is despised.
Who does not trust enough will not be trusted.

--

Empty yourself of everything.
Let the mind become still.
The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.
They grow and flourish and then return to the source.
Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.

--

The Master observes the world, but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is as open as the sky.

--

From caring comes courage.

--

In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.

--

Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses.

--

An ant on the move does more than a dozing ox.

--

Love the whole world as if it were your self; then you will truly care for all things.

--

Of all that is good, sublimity is supreme. Succeeding is the coming together of all that is beautiful. Furtherance is the agreement of all that is just. Perseverance is the foundation of all actions.

--

Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.

--

The Wise Man is square but not sharp, honest but not not malign, straight but not severe, bright but not dazzling.

--

A good runner leaves no footprints.

--

To bear and not to own; to act and not lay claim; to do the work and let it go: for just letting it go is what makes it stay.

--

One who is too insistent on his own views, finds few to agree with him.

--

Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere.

--

Going on means going far, going far means returning.

--

Softness triumphs over hardness, feebleness over strength. What is more malleable is always superior over that which is immoveable. This is the principle of controlling things by going along with them, of mastery through adaptation.

--

Accept disgrace willingly... Accept being unimportant... Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things. Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.

--

He who knows himself is enlightened.

--

The mystical techniques for achieving immortality are revealed only to those who have dissolved all ties to the gross worldly realm of duality, conflict, and dogma. As long as your shallow worldly ambitions exist, the door will not open.

--

I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures.

--

If a person seems wicked, do not cast him away. Awaken him with your words, elevate him with your deeds, repay his injury with your kindness. Do not cast him away; cast away his wickedness.

--

In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don't try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.

--

He who is contented is rich.

--

At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want.

--

The higher the sun ariseth, the less shadow doth he cast; even so the greater is the goodness, the less doth it covet praise; yet cannot avoid its rewards in honours.

--

The snow goose need not bathe to make itself white. Neither need you do anything but be yourself.

--

A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.

--

He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.

--

So the unwanting soul sees what's hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants.

--

The world is won by those who let it go.

--

The world's big things only can be done by paying attention to their humble beginnings.

--

Clay is fashioned into vessels; it is on their empty hollowness that their use depends. Doors and windows are cut out to make a dwelling, and on the empty space within, its use depends. Thus, while the existence of things may be good, it is the non-existence in them that makes them serviceable.

--

The power of intuitive understanding will protect you from harm until the end of your days.

--

Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, have few desires.

--

Can you love or guide someone without any kind of expectation?

--

Without stirring abroad, One can know the whole world; Without looking out of the window One can see the way of heaven. The further one goes The less one knows.

--

The more laws and order are made prominent, the more thieves and robbers there will be.

--

It is hidden but always present.

--

If you see what is small as it sees itself, and accept what is weak for what strength it has, and use what is dim for the light it gives then all will go well. This is called Acting Naturally.

--

We put thirty spokes to make a wheel: But it is on the hole in the center that the use of the cart hinges. We make a vessel from a lump of clay; But it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful. We make doors and windows for a room; But it is the empty spaces that make the room livable. Thus, while existence has advantages, It is the emptiness that makes it useful.

--

From wonder into wonder existence opens.

--

To realize that you do not understand is a virtue; Not to realize that you do not understand is a defect.

--

Clay is moulded to make a vessel, but the utility of the vessel lies in the space where there is nothing. . . . Thus, taking advantage of what is, we recognize the utility of what is not.

--

Can you comprehend everything in the four directions and still do nothing?

--

Those who have knowledge, don't predict. Those who predict, don't have knowledge.

--

He who holds balance...has attained the highest post in the world.

--

When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

--

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.

--

Silence is a source of great strength.

--

The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.

--

The usefulness of a pot comes from its emptiness.

--

I do not concern myself with gods and spirits either good or evil nor do I serve any.

--

Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.

--

Heaven is long-enduring, and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves.

--

A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.

--

If you wish to be out front, then act as if you were behind.

--

The more sharp weapons people have in a country, the bigger the disorder will be.

--

When the best leader's work is done the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'

--

Observe how endings become beginnings.

--

The biggest in the world is small in its beginning.

--

If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.

--

To understand the limitation of things, desire them.

--

Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. Good words are not persuasive; persuasive words are not good.

--

The wicked leader is he who the people despise. The good leader is he who the people revere. The great leader is he who the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'

--

He who talks more is sooner exhausted.

--

If you go searching for the Great Creator, you will come back empty-handed. The source of the universe is ultimately unknowable, a great invisible river flowing forever through a vast and fertile valley. Silent and uncreated, it creates all things.

--

How could man rejoice in victory and delight in the slaughter of men?

--

The sage does not hoard. The more he helps others, the more he benefits himself, The more he gives to others, the more he gets himself. The Way of Heaven does one good but never does one harm. The Way of the sage is to act but not to compete.

--

He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know.

--

The sage does not act and therefore does not fail, does not seize and therefore does not lose.

--

For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions.

--

People in their handlings of affairs often fail when they are about to succeed. If one remains as careful at the end as he was at the beginning, there will be no failure.

--

The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world.

--

Of the best rulers, The people only know that they exist; the next best they love and praise the next they fear; and the next they revile. When they do not command the people's faith, some will lose faith in them, and then they resort to oaths! But of the best when their task is accomplished, their work done, the people all remark, We have done it ourselves.

--

To become learned, each day add something. To become enlightened, each day drop something.

--

Be the chief but never the lord.

--

When virtue is lost, benevolence appears, when benevolence is lost right conduct appears, when right conduct is lost, expedience appears. Expediency is the mere shadow of right and truth; it is the beginning of disorder.

--

Mastering others is strength. Mastering yourself is true power.

--

Man's enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself.

--

People are born soft and weak. They die hard and stiff.

--

If the Great Way perishes there will morality and duty. When cleverness and knowledge arise great lies will flourish. When relatives fall out with one another there will be filial duty and love. When states are in confusion there will be faithful servants.

--

He who does not trust enough, Will not be trusted.

--

He who regards the world as he does the fortune of his own body can govern the world. He who loves the world as he does his own body can be entrusted with the world.

--

A great nation is like a great man:When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.Having realized it, he admits it.Having admitted it, he corrects it.He considers those who point out his faultsas his most benevolent teachers.He thinks of his enemyas the shadow that he himself casts.

--

Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.

--

Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt.

--

The superior leader keeps informed about everything but interferes hardly at all.

--

The ancient Masters didn't try to educate the people, but kindly taught them to not-know. When they think that they know the answers, people are difficult to guide. When they know that they don't know, people can find their own way. If you want to learn how to govern, avoid being clever or rich. The simplest pattern is the clearest. Content with an ordinary life, you can show all people the way back to their own true nature.

--

Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish - too much handling will spoil it.

--

He who knows others is clever; He who knows himself has discernment.

--

He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.

--

Highest good is like water. Because water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes closest to the way.

--

If you understand others you are smart.
If you understand yourself you are illuminated.
If you overcome others you are powerful.
If you overcome yourself you have strength.
If you know how to be satisfied you are rich.
If you can act with vigor, you have a will.
If you don't lose your objectives you can be long-lasting.
If you die without loss, you are eternal.

--

If people do not revere the Law of Nature It will adversely affect them. If they accept It with knowledge and reverence, It will accommodate them with balance and harmony.

--

Once upon a time a man whose ax was missing suspected his neighbor's son. The boy walked like a thief, looked like a thief and spoke like a thief. But the man found his ax while digging in the valley, and the next time he saw his neighbor's son, the boy walked, looked and spoke like any other child.

--

Great acts are made up of small deeds.

--

Each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life. The secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can. I wish you Happy New Year and diary full of best stories ever written in your life.

--

Because of a great love, one is courageous.

--

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name. The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; the Named is the mother of all things.

--

Knowing others is wisdom, knowing yourself is Enlightenment.

--

Words spoken about the Way have no taste. When looked at, there's not enough to see. When listened to, there's not enough to hear. When used, it is never exhausted.

--

The flame that burns Twice as bright burns half as long.

--

The more clever and cunning people are, the stranger the events will be.

--

He who accounts all things easy will have many difficulties.

--

Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.

--

Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the various creatures as straw dogs; the sage is ruthless, and treats others as straw dogs.

--

The value of teaching without words and accomplishing without action is understood by few in the world.

--

All things in the world come from being. And being comes from non-being.

--

All difficult things have their origin in that which is easy, and great things in that which is small.

--

If you practice inaction, nothing will be left undone: For the way to acquire lordship over society is by invariably not interfering.

--

Music in the soul can be heard by the universe.

--

Act without striving. Work without interfering. Find the flavour in what is flavourless.

--

If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you cannot achieve.

--

The high must make the low its base.

--

Those who die without being forgotten get longevity.

--

The real key to health and happiness and success is self knowledge.

--

Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn't try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms. For every force there is a counterforce. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. The Master does his job and then stops. He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao. Because he believes in himself, he doesn't try to convince others. Because he is content with himself, he doesn't need others' approval. Because he accepts himself, the whole world accepts him.

--

There was something undifferentiated and yet complete, which existed before Heaven and Earth. Soundless and formless, it depends on nothing and does not change. It operates everywhere and is free from danger. It may be considered the mother of the universe. I do not know its name; I call it Tao.

--

Favor and disgrace are like fear. Favor is in a higher place, and disgrace in a lower place. When you win them you are like being in fear, and when you lose them you are also like being in fear. So favor and disgrace are like fear.

--

Geese are white, crows are black. No argument will change this.

--

Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is.

--

It is better to do one's own duty, however defective it may be, than to follow the duty of another, however well one may perform it. He who does his duty as his own nature reveals it, never sins.

--

To know yet to think that one does not know is best; Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.

--

Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.

--

My teachings are easy to understand and easy to put into practice. Yet your intellect will never grasp them, and if you try to practice them, you'll fail. My teachings are older than the world. How can you grasp their meaning? If you want to know me, look inside your heart.

--

If you would take, you must first give, this is the beginning of intelligence.

--

Returning to the source is serenity.

--

Those who are right do not argue. Those who argue are not right.

--

The words of truth are always paradoxical. To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.

--

Nature is not human hearted.

--

People are difficult to govern because they have too much knowledge.

--

Abandon knowledge and your worries are over.

--

The best way to live / is to be like water / For water benefits all things / and goes against none of them.

--

The wise man is one who knows what he does not know.

--

Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it.

--

If you never assume importance, you never lose it.

--

Keeping plenty of gold and jade in the palace makes no one able to defend it.

--

When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.

--

If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.

--

Cultivate virtue in the world, and it will be universal.

--

When a nation is filled with strife, then do patriots flourish.

--

See others as yourself. See families as your family. See towns as your town. See countries as your country. See worlds as your world.

--

Those who are unswerving have resolve.

--

Searching for precious goods leads astray.

--

ALL things in Nature work silently. They come into being and possess nothing. They fulfil their functions and make no claim.

--

Obscure, like muddy waters.

--

The best way to carve is not to split.

--

Conduct your triumph as a funeral.

--

We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it liveable.

--

Excellent conquerors do not engage.

--

Treat those who are good with goodness, and also treat those who are not good with goodness. Thus goodness is attained. Be honest to those who are honest, and be also honest to those who are not honest. Thus honesty is attained.

--

Without opening your door, you can open your heart to the world. Without looking out your window, you can see the essence of the Tao. The more you know, the less you understand. The Master arrives without leaving, sees the light without looking, achieves without doing a thing.

--

The sage is not ill, because he sees illness as illness.

--

. . . These are notions of the mind, which is like a knife, always chipping away at the Tao, trying to render it graspable and manageable. But that which is beyond form is ungraspable, and that which is beyond knowing is unmanageable. There is, however, this consolation: She who lets go of the knife will find the Tao at her fingertips.

--

The wise man puts himself last and finds himself first.

--

Use the light that is in you to recover your natural clearness of sight.

--

When the effective leader is finished with his work, the people say it happened naturally.

--

The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas. Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way.

--

I observe myself and I come to know others.

--

Rituals are the end of fidelity and honesty, and the beginning of confusion.

--

He who knows much about others may be learned, but he who understands himself is more intelligent. He who controls others may be powerful, but he who has mastered himself is mightier still.

--

Force is followed by loss of strength. This is not the way of the Tao. That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.

--

The Tao never acts with force, yet there is nothing that it can not do.

--

My words have an origin. My deeds have a sovereign. Truly, because people do not understand this, they do not understand me.

--

We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use.

--

Yet mystery and imagination arise from the same source. This source is called darkness ... Darkness within darkness, the gateway to all understanding.

--

Displaying riches and titles with pride brings about one's downfall.

--

Things flourish, then each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness: Stillness is called return to life, return to life is called the constant; knowing the constant is called enlightenment.

--

The hard and stiff will be broken. 
The soft and supple will prevail.

--

The scholar gains every day; the man of Tao loses every day.

--

When everyone sees good, then bad exists.

--

Nothing in the world is more flexible and yielding than water. Yet when it attacks the firm and the strong, none can withstand it, because they have no way to change it. So the flexible overcome the adamant, the yielding overcome the forceful. Everyone knows this, but no one can do it.

--

Don't imagine that you'll discover {the truth} by accumulating more knowledge. Knowledge creates doubt, and doubt makes you ravenous for more knowledge. You can't get full eating this way.

--

Other people are occupied, I alone am unwilling, like the outcast.

--

Because he (the Sage) demands no honor, he will never be dishonored.

--

Simply see that you are at the center of the universe, and accept all things and beings as parts of your infinite body. When you perceive that an act done to another is done to yourself, you have understood the great truth.

--

Be truly whole, and all things will return to you.

--

He who controls the past controls the future.

--

When the Way is lost there is virtue. When virtue is lost there is benevolence. When benevolence is lost there is righteousness. When righteousness is lost there are rituals.

--

Rushing into action, you fail. Trying to grasp things, you lose them. Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe.

--

The mature person perceives the fruitlessness of rigid, external methodologies; Remembering this, he keeps his attitude unstructured at all times and thus is always free to pursue the Integral Way. He studies the teachings of the masters. He dissolves all concepts of duality. He pours himself out in service to others.

--

How can a man's life keep it's course If he will not let it flow, Those who flow as life flows know They need no other force: They feel no wear, they feel no tear, They need no mending, no repair.

--

All things carry yin and embrace yang. They reach harmony by blending with the vital breath.

--

That which offers no resistance, overcomes the hardest substances.

--

The Way begets one; one begets two; two begets three; three begets the myriad creatures.

--

Do not conquer the world with force, for force only causes resistance. Thorns spring up when an army passes. Years of misery follow a great victory. Do only what needs to be done without using violence.

--

The ancients said: Hulk to be whole.

--

Those who would take over the earth and shape it to their will, never, I notice succeed.

--

Filling life exceedingly is called ominous.

--

A violent wind does not outlast the morning; a squall of rain does not outlast the day. Such is the course of Nature. And if Nature herself cannot sustain her efforts long, how much less can man!

--

From now back to antiquity, its (Tao's) name has not been lost. Thereby, see the origin of all.

--

Life is going forth; death is returning home.

--

The separate parts make no carriage.

--

People are hard to govern. The rulers interfere with too much. That is why people are hard to govern.

--

Those who take long steps cannot keep the pace.

--

The perfect square lacks corners.

--

The sage attends to the belly, and not to what he sees.

--

When people do not dread authorities, then a greater dread descends.

--

One who lives in accordance with nature does not go against the way of things but moves in harmony with the present moment.

--

The Way is empty, yet inexhaustible, like an abyss!

--

That which shrinks must first expand.

--

New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings.

--

Abandon benevolence, discard duty, and people will return to the family ties.

--

In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart.

--

In the highest antiquity, the people did not know that there were rulers. In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them.

--

We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move.

--

The inner is the foundation of the outer. The still is master of the restless. The Sage travels all day yet never leaves his inner treasure.

--

Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know. Close your mouth, block off your senses, blunt your sharpness, untie your knots, soften your glare, settle your dust. This is the primal identity. Be like the Tao. It can't be approached or withdrawn from, benefited or harmed, honored or brought into disgrace. It gives itself up continually. That is why it endures.

--

Wise men hear and see as little children do.

--

An integral being knows without going,
sees without looking, and accomplishes without doing.

--

Peace and quiet govern the world.

--

The forceful and violent will not die from natural causes.

--

Knowing constancy, the mind is open.
With an open mind, you will be openhearted.
Being openhearted you will act royally.
Being royal, you will attain the divine.
Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao.
Being at one with the Tao is eternal. 
Though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.

--

Those who praise themselves do not prevail.

--

In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired. In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped.

--

Giving to others selflesly and anonymously, radiating light throughout the world and illuminating your own darkness, your virtue becomes a sanctuary for yourself and all beings.

--

Freedom from desire leads to inner peace.

--

Tao invariably takes no action, and yet there is nothing left undone.

--

What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out.

--

Stillness is the ruler of haste.

--

If lightning is the anger of the gods, then the gods are concerned mostly about trees.

--

That, which others compress - will widen up and open. That, which others weaken - will strengthen. That, which others destroy - will blossom. Whoever wished to take something from the other, will inevitably loose his own.

--

Nurture the spontaneous peaceful life.

--

The wise man looks back into the past, and does not grieve over what is far off, nor rejoice over what is near; for he knows that time is without end.

--

What resists, persists.

--

The rigid tree will be felled.

--

What has not yet emerged is easy to prevent.

--

The ten thousand things flourish and then each returns to the root from which it came. Returning to the root is stillness. Through stillness each fulfils its destiny.

--

A tree that cannot bend will crack in the wind. Thus by nature's own decree, the soft and gentle are triumphant.

--

Take [preventive] action before things happen. Establish order before disorder has begun.

--

The greatest revelation is stillness.

--

When life begins we are tender and weak When life ends we are stiff and rigid All things, including the grass and trees, are soft and pliable in life and dry in brittle in death So the soft and supple are the companion of life While the stiff and unyielding are the companions of death An army that cannot yield will be defeated A tree that cannot bend will crack in the wind Thus by Nature's own decree the hard and strong are defeated while the soft and gentle are triumphant.

--

A multitude of words is tiresome, unlike remaining centered.

--

All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power. If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them. If you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them. The Master is above the people, and no one feels oppressed. She goes ahead of the people, and no one feels manipulated. The whole world is grateful to her. Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her.

--

The best soldier does not attack. The superior fighter succeeds without violence. The greatest conqueror wins without struggle. The most successful manager leads without dictating. This is intelligent non aggressiveness.

--

In the Golden Age, Rulers were unknown. In the following age Rulers were loved and praised. Next came the age When rulers were feared. Finally the age When rulers are hated.

--

Clay is used to make vases, but it is the emptiness they contain that makes them useful.

--

The further one goes, the less (he realizes he) one knows.

--

Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity. If you don't realize the source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow. When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king. Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.

--

He who stands on tiptoe is not steady. He who strides cannot maintain the pace. He who makes a show is not enlightened. He who is self-righteous is not respected. He who boasts achieves nothing. He who brags will not endure. According to followers of the Tao, "These are extra food and unnecessary luggage." They do not bring happiness, therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.

--

The more we give to others, the more we are increased.

--

Why separate your spiritual life and your practical life? To an integral being, there is no such distinction.

--

The sage avoids extremity, excess, and extravagance.

--

Throw away profit and greed, and there won't be any thieves.

--

If you close your mind in judgements and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled. If you keep your mind from judging and aren't led by the senses, your heart will find peace.

--

When they lose their sense of awe, people turn to religion. When they no longer trust themselves, they begin to depend upon authority. Therefore the Master steps back so that people won't be confused. He teaches without a teaching, so that people will have nothing to learn.

--

The heavy is the root of the light. The tranquil is the ruler of the hasty.

--

Heaven's Way is like stretching a bow. The high is lowered and the low is raised. Excess is reduced and deficiency is replenished. Heaven's Way reduces excess and replenishes deficiency. People's Way is not so. They reduce the deficient and supply the excessive.

--

When the government is quite unobtrusive, people are indeed pure. When the government is quite prying, people are indeed conniving.

--

Mold clay into a bowl. The empty space makes it useful.

--

The sage acts without taking credit. He accomplishes without dwelling on it. He does not want to display his worth.

--

Once you arrive {at a spontaneous awareness of the Great Oneness}, remember: it isn't necessary to struggle to maintain unity with it. All you have to do is participate in it.

--

When two opposing sides meet in battle, the one without an enemy will be victorious.

--

The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and her has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body. He doesn't think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being. He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day's work.

--

He who possess virtue in abundance may be compared to an infant.

--

The subtlest of subtleties, this is the gateway to all mysteries.

--

To practice virtue is to selflessly offer assistance to others, giving without limitation one's time, abilities, and possessions in service, whenever and wherever needed, without prejudice concerning the identity of those in need.

--

Attain utmost emptiness. Abide in steadfast stillness.

--

The river and the sea can be kings of a hundred valleys, because they lie below them.

--

I have the mind of a fool, understanding nothing.

--

The sturdiest virtue seems fragile.

--

As soon as you have made a thought, laugh at it.

--

The mature person perceives the fruitlessness of rigid, external methodologies.

--

Give up your relentless moralizing, the continual pinpricks which pierce the skin of your fellows. The distinction between good and evil is the sickness of the mind. Give up your morals, and the people will regain a love of their fellows.

--

Filling all the way to the brim is not as good as halting in time.

--

A tree trunk the size of a man grows from a blade as thin as a hair. A tower nine stories high is built from a small heap of earth.

--

I have three treasures that I cherish. The first is compassion. The second is moderation. The third is not claiming to be first in the world.

--

The softest of stuff in the world, penetrates quickly the hardest, insubstantial, it enters where there is no room.

--

When people are unsettled, loyal ministers arise.

--

Be humble and you will remain entire. The sages do not display themselves, therefore they shine. They do not approve themselves, therefore they are noted. They do not praise themselves, therefore they have merit. They do not glory in themselves, therefore they excel.

--

To manage your mind, know that there is nothing, and then relinquish all attachment to nothingness.

--

A great country needs more people to serve it. A small country needs more people to serve. So, if both shall get what they need, the great country ought to yield.

--

The sage honors his part of the settlement, but does not exact his due from others.

--

Warriors say: I dare not be like the host, but would rather be like the guest. I dare not advance an inch, but would rather retreat a foot.

--

Yielding, like ice about to melt.

--

In the end, The treasure of life is missed by those who hold on and gained by those who let go.

--

The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be. The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be. The more subsidies you have, the less self reliant people will be.

--

Abandon cleverness, discard profit, and thieves and robbers will disappear.

--

The sage is sharp but does not cut, pointed but does not pierce, forthright but does not offend, bright but does not dazzle.

--

If Heaven were not clear it might rend. If Earth were not firm it might crumble.

--

Without looking through the window, you can see Heaven's Way.

--

The world is a sacred vessel that cannot be changed. He who changes it will destroy it. He who seizes it will lose it.

--

Everything will settle in its own place automatically.

--

When the palace is magnificent, the fields are filled with weeds, and the granaries are empty.

--

The people starve because those above them eat too much tax-grain. That is the only reason why they starve.

--

The Tao principle is what happens of itself.

--

The eternal void is filled with infinite possibilities.

--

The master does his job and then stops. He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao.

--

There is no calamity greater than lavish desires. There is no greater guilt than discontent. And there is no greater disaster than greed.

--

Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking. Center your country in the Tao and evil will have no power. Not that it isn't there, but you'll be able to step out of its way. Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.

--

He who prides himself upon wealth and honor hastens his own downfall.

--

Can you open and close the gate of Heaven and act like a woman?

--

But in the present day men cast off gentleness, and are all for being bold; they spurn frugality, and retain only extravagance; they discard humility, and aim only at being first. Therefore they shall surely perish.

--

Must one dread what others dread?

--

Its name-what passes not away.

--

Conquering others requires force. Conquering oneself requires strength.

--

Silence is a source of great strenght.

--

A brave and passionate man will kill or be killed.
A brave and calm man will always preserve life.
Of these two which is good and which is harmful?

--

Strong winds do not last all morning, hard rains do not last all day.

--

The sage acts by doing nothing.

--

...The sage, traveling all day, Does not lose sight of his baggage. Though there are beautiful things to be seen, He remains unattached and calm.

--

Do not make them (people) weary at their work. If you do not make them weary, they will not be weary of you.

--

The supreme good is like water, which nourishes all things without trying to. It is content with the low places that people disdain. Thus it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don't try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.

--

Shape clay into a vessel; 
It is the space within that makes it useful. 
Cut doors and windows for a room; 
It is the holes which make it useful. 
Therefore benefit comes from what is there; 
Usefulness from what is not there.

--

Intelligent people know others. Enlightened people know themselves.

--

Love is the greatest link that we have with those who have temporarily left us.

--

The way is light and fluid for the man with no preferences.

--

The seed of mystery lies in muddy water. How can I perceive this mystery? Water becomes clear through stillness. How can I become still? By flowing with the stream.

--

Heaven and Earth last for ever. Why do Heaven and Earth last for ever? They are unborn, so ever living. The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.

--

Worlds and particles, bodies and beings, time and space: All are transient expressions of the Tao.

--

Perfection is the willingness to be imperfect.

--

Heaven is eternal, earth everlasting. they endure this way because they do not live for themselves. in the same way, the wise person puts himself last, and thereby finds himself first, holds himself outside, and thereby remains at the center, abandons himself, and is thereby fulfilled.

--

If you tell me, I will listen. If you show me, I will see. If you let me experience, I will learn!

--

The past has no power to stop you from being present now. Only your grievance about the past can do that. What is grievance? The baggage of old thought and emotion.

--

When the uncarved wood is split, its parts are put to use. When the sage is put to use, he becomes the head.

--

How can one liberate the many? By first liberating his own being. He does this not by elevating himself, but by lowering himself. He lowers himself to that which is simple, modest, true; integrating it into himself, he becomes a master of simplicity, modesty, truth.

--

Seeing the small is called Clarity.
Keeping flexible is called Strength.
Using the shining Radiance,
You enter the Light,
Where no harm can come to you.
This is called Enlightenment.

--

Other people are joyous, like on the feast of the ox, like on the way up to the terrace in the spring. I alone am inert, giving no sign, like a newborn baby who has not learned to smile.

--

He who acts, spoils; he who grasps, lets slip.

--

If a great country yields to a small country, it will conquer the small country. If a small country yields to a great country, it will be conquered by the great country.

--

The wise cares about everyone, and he becomes an example to all.

--

What should be shrunken must first be stretched.

--

If your virtue is especially radiant, it can be possible to open a pathway to the subtle realm and receive these celestial teachings directly from the immortals.

--

If you search everywhere, yet cannot find what you are seeking, it is because what you seek is already in your possession.

--

When you let go of what you are, you become what you might be.

--

The universe is deathless; Is deathless because, having no finite self, it stays infinite. A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead of himself, By not confining himself to himself sustains himself outside himself: By never being an end in himself he endlessly becomes himself.

--

The sage knows without traveling, perceives without looking, completes without acting.

--

Stillness overcomes heat.

--

There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war.

--

Superior leaders get things done with very little motion. They impart instruction not through many words, but through a few deeds. They keep informed about everything but interfere hardly at all. They are catalysts, and though things would not get done as well if they were not there, when they succeed they take no credit. And, because they take no credit, credit never leaves them.

--

Therefore the Sage, wishing to be above the people, must by his words put himself below them; wishing to be before the people, he must put himself behind them. In this way, though he has his place above them, the people do not feel his weight; though he has his place before them, they do not feel it as an injury. Therefore all mankind delight to exalt him, and weary of him not.

--

Those who stand on their toes are not steady.

--

Accomplish but do not boast, accomplish without show, accomplish without arrogance, accomplish without grabbing, accomplish without forcing.

--

The most eloquent seems to stutter.

--

Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return.

--

Things exalted then decay. This is going against the Way. What goes against the Way meets an early end.

--

The Tao's principle is spontaneity.

--

The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine.

--

I do not act, and people become reformed by themselves.

--

A skillful commander is not overbearing. A skillful fighter does not become angry. A skillful conqueror does not compete with people. One who is skillful in using men puts himself below them. This is called the strength to use men. This is called matching Heaven, The highest principle of old.

--

There is a thing inherent and natural which existed before heaven and earth. Motionless and fathomless, It stands alone and never changes; It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted. It may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe. I do not know its name. If I am forced to give It a name, I call it Tao, and I name it as supreme.

--

All things issue from it; all things return to it. To find the origin, trace back the manifestations. When you recognize the children and find the mother, you will be free of sorrow. If you close your mind in judgements and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled. If you keep your mind from judging and aren't led by the senses, your heart will find peace. Seeing into darkness is clarity. Knowing how to yield is strength. Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity.

--

Those who are highly evolved, maintain an undiscriminating perception. Seeing everything, labeling nothing, they maintain their awareness of the Great Oneness. Thus they are supported by it.

--

Activity conquers coldness. Stillness conquers heat.

--

Battles are followed by years of famine.

--

To rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder.

--

To delight in conquest is to delight in slaughter.

--

The True Person governs by emptying the heart of desire and filling the belly with food, weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.

--

The one who does not honor the teacher and the one who does not honor the task, although ever so knowledgeable, they are confused.

--

The Master views the parts with compassion, because he understands the whole. His constant practice is humility. He doesn't glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the Tao, as rugged and common as a stone.

--

Those who defeat others are strong, those who defeat themselves are mighty.

--

To realize that our knowledge is ignorance, This is a noble insight. To regard our ignorance as knowledge, This is mental sickness. Only when we are sick of the sickness Shall we cease to be sick. The Sage is not sick, being sick of sickness; This is the secret of health.

--

Because clarity and enlightenment are within your own nature, they are regained without moving an inch.

--

Not all spiritual paths lead to the harmonious Oneness. Indeed, most are detours and distractions, nothing more.

--

There is no greater offence than harbouring desires. There is no greater disaster than discontent. There is no greater misfortune than wanting more.

--

The highest virtue seems as low as a valley.

--

The sage wears coarse clothes, concealing jade.

--

The higher the sun ariseth, the less shadow doth he cast; even so the greater is the goodness, the less doth it covet praise; yet cannot avoid its rewards in honors.

--

When the ancient Masters said, "If you want to be given everything, give everything up," they weren't using empty phrases. Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.

--

Trying to understand is like straining through muddy water. Be still and allow the mud to settle.

--

Stillness is easy to maintain.

--

When many people are killed, they should be mourned and lamented. Those who are victorious in war should follow the rites of funerals.

--

Hear no evil. See no evil. Speak no evil.

--

I have three treasures which I hold and keep. The first is mercy; the second is economy. The third is daring not to be ahead of others. From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity; From humility comes leadership.

--

Heaven's net is very vast. It is sparsely meshed, yet nothing slips through.

--

Act without doing; work without effort. Think of the small as large and the few as many. Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts. The Master never reaches for the great; thus she achieves greatness. When she runs into a difficulty, she stops and gives herself to it. She doesn't cling to her own comfort; thus problems are no problem for her.

--

You should rule a great country As you would fry a small fish- With the least turning.

--

To know others is to have knowledge. To know yourself is to be enlightened.

--

If princes and kings were not exalted they might be overthrown.

--

Surrender your self-interest. Love others as much as you love yourself. Then you can be entrusted with all things under heaven.

--

The sage regards things as difficult, and thereby avoids difficulty.

--

The real art of governing consists, so far as possible, in doing nothing.

--

Yielding is the way of the Tao.

--

If princes and kings could follow it (Tao), all things would by themselves abide, Heaven and Earth would unite and sweet dew would fall. People would by themselves find harmony, without being commanded.

--

The man of knowledge acquires something new everyday, and the man of Tao lets go of something new every day.

--

The supreme rulers are hardly known by their subjects. The lesser are loved and praised. The even lesser are feared. The least are despised.

--

When the people of the world all know beauty as beauty, There arises the recognition of ugliness. When they all know the good as good, There arises the recognition of evil.

--

The truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface.

--

The Master keeps her mind always at one with the Tao; that is what gives her her radiance. The Tao is ungraspable. How can her mind be at one with it? Because she doesn't cling to ideas. The Tao is dark and unfathomable. How can it make her radiant? Because she lets it. Since before time and space were, the Tao is. It is beyond is and is not. How do I know this is true? I look inside myself and see.

--

All things in nature work silently. They come into being and possess nothing. They fulfill their function and make no claim. All things alike do their work, and then we see them subside. When they have reached their bloom, each returns to its origin. . . . This reversion is an eternal law. To know that law is wisdom.

--

Be merciful, moderate, and modest.

--

There was something that finished chaos, born before Heaven and Earth.

--

Seal the openings, shut the doors, dull the sharpness, untie the knots, dim the light, become one with the dust. This is called the profound union.

--

Too much success is not an advantage.
Do not tinkle like jade
Or clatter like stone chimes.

--

In stillness the muddied water returns to clarity.

--

Dignified, like a guest.

--

When the hares have all been caught, the hunting dogs are cooked.

--

A good counter needs no calculator.

--

The weak overcomes the strong. The soft overcomes the hard. Everybody in the world knows this, still nobody makes use of it.

--

Failure is the foundation of success: success is the lurking place of failure.

--

The rigid and big belong below. The soft and weak belong above.

--

Excellent warriors are not violent.

--

When Simplicity is broken up, it is made into instruments. Evolved individuals who employ them, are made into leaders. In this way, the Great System is United.

--

Never take over the world to tamper with it. Those who want to tamper with it are not fit to take over the world.

--

A good calculator does not need artificial aids.

--

Whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. What is soft is strong.

--

Your name or your body, what is dearer? Your body or your wealth, what is worthier?

--

Who can wait in stillness while the mud settles?

--

What Heaven detests, who knows why? Even the sage considers it difficult.

--

Tao loves and nourishes all things, but does not dominate it over them.

--

Heaven's Way gives no favors. It always remains with good people.

--

A vessel is formed from a lump of clay with care, however, it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.

--

Reputation should be neither sought nor avoided.

--

To joy in conquest is to joy in the loss of human life.

--

Loss is not as bad as wanting more.

--

Wear down to be renewed.

--

Those who know are wise. Those who know themselves are enlightened.

--

You cannot receive what you don't give. Outflow determines inflow.

--

Attending fully and becoming supple, Can you be as a newborn babe?

--

The sage wears clothes of coarse cloth but carries jewels in his bosom; He knows himself but does not display himself; He loves himself but does not hold himself in high esteem.

--

Why is the tao so valuable? Because it is everywhere, and everyone can use it. This is why those who seek will find, And those who reform will be forgiven; Why the good will be rewarded, And the thief who is cunning will escape.

--

The sage never strives for greatness, and can therefore accomplish greatness.

--

Because one believes in oneself, one doesn't try to convince. Because one is content with oneself, one doesn't need others' approval. Because one accepts oneself, the whole world accepts him or her.

--

In order to eliminate the negative influences, simply ignore them.

--

The world is ruled by letting things take their course. It cannot be ruled by interfering.

--

People take death lightly. They expect too much of life. That is why people take death lightly.

--

Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.

--

If you overesteem great men, people become powerless. If you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal. The Master leads by emptying people's minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. He helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know. Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.

--

Misery is what happiness rests upon. Happiness is what misery lurks beneath.

--

Those who know when it is enough will not perish.

--

He who loves does not dispute: He who disputes does not love.

--

To the good I would be good; to the not-good I would also be good, in order to make them good.

--

Without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony.

--

To conquer others is to have power, to conquer yourself is to know the way.

--

They can see their neighbors. Roosters and dogs can be heard from there. Still, they will age and die without visiting one another.

--

Because he (the Sage) opposes no one, no one in the world can oppose him.

--

The heavy is the root of the light. The unmoved is the source of all movement. Thus the Master travels all day without leaving home. However splendid the views, she stays serenely in herself. Why should the lord of the country flit about like a fool? If you let yourself be blown to and fro, you lose touch with your root. If you let restlessness move you, you lose touch with who you are.

--

Do not fear the aging of the body for it is the body's way of seeking the root.

--

The well-run group is not a battlefield of egos.

--

There is a big misunderstanding about the idea of naturalness. Most people who come to us believing in some freedom or naturalness, but their understanding is what we call [heretical naturalness] ... a kind of "let-alone policy" or sloppiness... For a plant or stone to be natural is no problem. But for us there is some problem, indeed a big problem. To be natural is something we must work on.

--

What is well rooted cannot be pulled up. What is firmly grasped will not slip loose. It will be honoured from generation to generation.

--

The True Person avoids extremes, self-indulgence, and extravagance.

--

The most able seems clumsy.

--

The truly wise are content to be last. They are, therefore, first. They are indifferent to themselves. They are, therefore self-confident.

--

Harmony is called the eternal. Knowing the eternal is called clarity.

--

Nature doesn't make long speeches.

--

The living are soft and yielding; the dead are rigid and stiff. Living plants are flexible and tender; the dead are brittle and dry.

--

Chanting is no more holy than listening to the murmur of a stream, counting prayer beads no more sacred than simply breathing. . . . If you wish to attain oneness with the Tao, don't get caught up in spiritual superficialities.

--

He who, conscious of being strong, is content to be weak, he shall be the paragon of mankind. Being the paragon of mankind, Virtue will never desert him. He returns to the state of a little child.

--

Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.

--

The soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong.

--

Peace and quiet are preferred. Victory should not be praised.

--

The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil.

--

If you wish to become a divine immortal angel, then restore the angelic qualities of your being through virtue and service. This is the only way to gain the attention of the immortals... These angelic teachers cannot be sought out; it is they who seek out the student. When you succeed in connecting your energy with the divine realm through high awareness and the practice of undiscriminating virtue, the transmission of the ultimate subtle truths will follow.

--

When the emperor is crowned or the three dukes are appointed, rather than sending a gift of jade carried by four horses, remain still and offer the Way.

--

The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao.

--

A violent wind does not last for a whole morning.

--

. . . learn to value what is important today in the subtle realm rather than what appears desirable tomorrow in the worldly realm.

--

Does one scent appeal more than another? Do you prefer this flavor, or that feeling? Is your practice sacred and your work profane? Then your mind is separated: from itself, from oneness, from the Tao.

--

To be brave without compassion, generous without moderation, and rule without refraining from being first in the world, are certain deaths.

--

Every being in the universe is an expression of the Tao. It springs into existence, unconscious, perfect, free, takes on a physical body, lets circumstances complete it. That is why every being spontaneously honors the Tao. The Tao gives birth to all beings, nourishes them, maintains them, cares for them, comforts them, protects them, takes them back to itself, creating without possessing, acting without expecting, guiding without interfering. That is why love of the Tao is in the very nature of things.

--

That which offers no resistance can enter where there is no space.

--

To retreat after a work well done is Heaven's Way.

--

Do not attempt to conquer the world with force, for force only causes resistance.

--

Good words shall gain you honor in the marketplace, but good deeds shall gain you friends among men.

--

Therefore, if a great kingdom humbles itself before a small kingdom, it shall make that small kingdom its prize. And if a small kingdom humbles itself before a great kingdom, it shall win over that great kingdom. Thus the one humbles itself in order to attain, the other attains because it is humble. If the great kingdom has no further desire than to bring men together and to nourish them, the small kingdom will have no further desire than to enter the service of the other. But in order that both may have their desire, the great one must learn humility.

--

Kindness in thought leads to wisdom. Kindness in speech leads to eloquence. Kindness in action leads to love.

--

Returning to the source is stillness. It is returning to one's fate. Returning to one's fate is eternal.

--

The leader's main job is to make themselves obsolete.

--

If there is to be peace in the home, There must be peace in the heart.

--

Ancient masters of excellence had a subtle essence, and a depth too profound to comprehend.

--

The more laws and restrictions there are, 
The poorer people become. 
The sharper men's weapons, 
The more trouble in the land.

--

I do not interfere, and people become rich by themselves.

--

Have patience. Wait until the mud settles and the water is clear. Remain unmoving until right action arises by itself.

--

Can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things?

--

The Sage expects no recognition for what he does; he achieves merit but does not take it to himself; he does not wish to display his worth.

--

Water benefits the ten thousand things and does not oppose them.

--

In the world there are four greats, and the king is one of them.

--

Holding on to the weak is called strength.

--

Knowing that we don't know it's humility; thinking that we know what we don't know, is sickness.

--

Moderation means prevention. Prevention means achieving much virtue.

Fame or integrity: which is more important? Money or happiness: which is more valuable? Success or failure: which is more destructive? If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.

--

Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.

--

In order to contract, It is necessary first to expand. In order to weaken, It is necessary first to strengthen. In order to destroy, It is first necessary to promote. In order to grasp, It is necessary first to give. This is called subtle light. The weak and the tender overcome the hard and the strong.

--

I confess that there is nothing to teach: no religion, no science, no writings which will lead your mind back to Spirit. Today I speak this way, tomorrow that, but always the Path is beyond words and beyond mind.

--

The men who are great live with that which is substantial, they do not stay with that which is superficial; they abide with realities, they do not remain with what is showy. The one they discard, the other they hold.

--

Having reached a high level of realization (or having accomplished anything in life), don't get excited or puffed up with pride but remain calm, humble, and in "perfect equanimity" if you want to continue in this deep state of consciousness.

--

A good wanderer leaves no trace.

--

Acting without design, occupying oneself without making a business of it, finding the great in what is small and the many in the few, repaying injury with kindness, effecting difficult things while they are easy, and managing great things in their beginnings; this is the method of Tao.

--

A climb of eight hundred feet starts where the foot stands.

--

A good manager is best when people barely know that he exists. Not so good when people obey and acclaim him. Worse when they despise him.

--

The unyielding army will not win.

--

Some lose yet gain, others gain and yet lose.

--

He who steals a hook shall be hanged; while he who steals the state shall be crowned as prince.

--

The Master doesn't seek fulfillment. For only those who are not full are able to be used which brings the feeling of completeness.

--

The great Way is all-pervading. It reaches to the left and to the right. All things depend on it with their existence. Still it demands no obedience.

--

He (the sage) is good to those who are good. He is also good to those who are not good. That is the virtue of good.

--

Be careful what you water your dreams with. Water them with worry and fear and you will produce weeds that choke the life from your dream.

--

The sense organs, which are limited in scope and ability, randomly gather information. This partial information is arranged into judgments, which are based on previous judgments, which are usually based on someone else's foolish ideas. These false concepts and ideas are then stored in a highly selective memory system.

--

He that humbles himself shall be preserved entire. He that bends shall be made straight. He that is empty shall be filled. He that is worn out shall be renewed. He who has little shall succeed. He who has much shall go astray.

--

Make your heart like a lake, with calm, still surface, and great depths of kindness.

--

Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity.

--

Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity.

--

Quiet your mind and stop judging and resisting and manipulating the natural way.

--

Heaven's Way does not contend, yet it certainly triumphs. It does not speak, yet it certainly answers. It does not summon, yet things come by themselves. It seems to be at rest, yet it certainly has a plan.

--

The eye with which you see God is the same eye with which God sees you; one in seeing; one in knowing; one in loving.

--

In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple.

--

Because of deep love, one is courageous. Because of frugality, one is generous. Because of not daring to be ahead of the world, one becomes the leader of the world.

--

Throw away sacredness and wisdom and people will be one hundred times happier.

--

Dualistic thinking is a sickness.

--

Open yourself to the truth, then trust in your natural responses, and everything will fall into place.

--

Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death. The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.

--

I alone am different from the others, because I am nourished by the great mother.

--

Conquering the world and changing it, I do not think it can succeed.

--

There is one appointed supreme executioner. Truly, trying to take the place of the supreme executioner is like trying to carve wood like a master carpenter. Of those who try to carve wood like a master carpenter, there are few who do not injure their hands.

--

Success is as dangerous as failure.
Hope is as hollow as fear.

What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?
Whether you go up the ladder or down it,
you position is shaky.
When you stand with your two feet on the ground,
you will always keep your balance.

What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?
Hope and fear are both phantoms
that arise from thinking of the self.
When we don't see the self as self,
what do we have to fear?

See the world as your self.
Have faith in the way things are.
Love the world as your self;
then you can care for all things.

--

. . . the integral being is attached to nothing and can relate to everyone with an unstructured attitude. Because of this, her very existence benefits all things.

--

The brittle is easy to shatter.

--

It's hard to keep your balance standing tip-toe.

--

No disaster is worse than being discontented.

--

Do you think you can make the world a better place? I do not think you can. It is already perfect.

--

The fourth (of the four cardinal virtues) is supportiveness: this manifests as service to others without expectation of reward. (Paraphrased: Such service is not a mere conforming to some external rule of behavior, but instead a manifestation of your original nature).

--

The greatest teacher has nothing to say. He simply gives himself in service, and never worries.

--

A tree that is unbending, is easily broken.

--

Not valuing wealth prevents theft.

--

A sage is skilled at helping people without excluding anyone.

--

The leader is a teacher who succeeds without taking credit. And, because credit is not taken, credit is received.

--

If people live in constant fear of death, and if breaking the law is punished by death, then who would dare?

--

Return animosity with virtue.

--

What is well planted will not be uprooted.

--

The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things. All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male. When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony. Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.

--

When equal armies battle, the grieving one will be victorious.

--

Correct becomes defect. Good becomes ominous. People's delusions have certainly lasted long.

--

There are three layers to the universe. In the lower, Tai Ching, and the middle, Shan Ching, the hindrance of a physical bodily existence is required. Those who fail to live consistently in accord with the Tao reside here. In the upper, Yu Ching, there is only Tao: the bondage of form is broken, and the only thing existing is the exquisite energy dance of the immortal divine beings.

--

The first practice is the practice of undiscriminating virtue: take care of those who are deserving; also, and equally, take care of those who are not. When you extend your virtue in all directions without discriminating, you feet are firmly planted on the path that returns to the Tao.

--

Let muddy water stand and it will become clear.

--

A winner listens, a loser just waits until it is their turn to talk.

--

Racing and hunting excite man's heart to madness.

--

Those who are quiet value the words. When their task is completed, people will say: We did it ourselves.

--

The sage governs by emptying senses and filling bellies.

--

The hard and stiff are death's companions. The soft and weak are life's companions.

--

The most fundamental seems fickle.

--

Quarrel with a friend - and you are both wrong.

--

The highest virtue is not virtuous. Therefore it has virtue. The lowest virtue holds on to virtue. Therefore it has no virtue.

--

Meet the difficult while it is easy.

--

The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world. Through this I know the advantage of taking no action.

--

People starve. The rulers consume too much with their taxes. That is why people starve.

--

Returning is the movement of the Way.

--

A good person is the bad person's teacher. A bad person is the good person's task.

--

The Tao doesn't take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil. The Master doesn't take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners. The Tao is like a bellows: it is empty yet infinitely capable. The more you use it, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you understand. Hold on to the center.

--

The Way is hidden and nameless. Still only the Way nourishes and completes.

--

When you accurately perceive the fluidity of things, you can also begin to perceive the constancy behind them: the creative, transformative, boundless, immutable Tao.

--

The one who is filled by virtue is like a newborn baby.

--

When the Way governs the world, the proud stallions drag dung carriages. When the Way is lost to the world, war horses are bred outside the city.

--

Knowledge of the eternal is all-embracing. To be all-embracing leads to righteousness, which is majestic.

--

True words are not pleasing. Pleasing words are not true.

--

A good mooring needs no knot, still no one can untie it.

--

In this world, there is nothing softer or thinner than water. But to compel the hard and unyielding, it has no equal. That the weak overcomes the strong, that the hard gives way to the gentle - this everyone knows. Yet no one asks accordingly.

--

When you find the way/ others will find you./ Passing by on the road/ they will be drawn to your door./ The way that cannot be heard/ will be echoed in your voice./ The way that cannot be seen/ will be reflected in your eyes.

--

He who walks on tip-toe does not walk on solid ground.

--

Thirty spokes are joined in the wheel's hub. The hole in the middle makes it useful.

--

Seeing the small is called clarity.

--

The great image lacks shape.

--

The wise man does not lay up treasure. The more he expends on others, the more he gains for himself. The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own.

--

It is the child that sees the primordial secret in Nature and it is the child of ourselves we return to. The child within us is simple and daring enough to live the Secret.

--

One's own self or material goods, which has more worth?
Loss (of self) or possession (of goods), which is the greater evil?
He who loves most, spends most,
He who hoards much loses much.

--

Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.

--

Yielding is the manner of the Way.

--

A government can be compared to our lungs. Our lungs are best when we don't realize they are helping us breathe. It is when we are constantly aware of our lungs that we know they have come down with an illness.

--

The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to yin and yang. Yin and yang give birth to all things... The complete whole is the complete whole. So also is any part the complete whole... But forget about understanding and harmonizing and making all things one. The universe is already a harmonious oneness; just realize it.

--

Human being's essential nature is perfect and faultless.

--

Don't think you can attain total awareness and whole enlightenment without proper discipline and practice. This is egomania. Appropriate rituals channel your emotions and life energy toward the light. Without the discipline to practice them, you will tumble constantly backward into darkness.

--

Cultivate virtue in yourself, and it will be true.

--

Rule your mind with serenity rather than with force and manipulation.

--

If you want everything, you first have to give everything up.

--

What man has more than enough and gives it to the world? Only the man of Tao.

--

The best soldiers are not warlike; the best fighters do not lose their temper. The greatest conquerors are those who overcome their enemies without strife. The greatest directors of men are those who yield place to others. This is called the Virtue of not striving, the capacity for directing mankind; this is being the compeer of Heaven. It was the highest goal of the ancients.

--

If you are untrustworthy, people will not trust you.

--

. . . integral wisdom involves a direct participation in every moment: the observer and the observed are dissolved in the light of pure awareness, and no mental concepts or attitudes are present to dim that light.

--

Some help others in order to receive blessings and admiration. This is simply meaningless. Some cultivate themselves in part to serve others, in part to serve their own pride. They will understand, at best, half of the truth. But those who improve themselves for the sake of the world - to these, the whole truth of the universe will be revealed.

--

When wisdom and knowledge appear, great pretense arises.

--

There is no greater disaster than discontent.

--

Don't impose your will through manipulation of aggressive emotions and actions.

--

There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent.

--

Nothing is weaker than water, Yet for overcoming what is hard and strong, Nothing surpasses it.

--

Every human being's essential nature is perfect and faultless, but after years of immersion in the world we easily forget our roots and take on a counterfeit nature.

--

Goodness strives not, and therefore it is not rebuked.

--

I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct.

--

The sage desires no desire, does not value rare treasures, learns without learning, recovers what people have left behind.

--

Can you care for the people and rule the country and not be cunning?

--

There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe. For lack of a better name, I call it the Tao. It flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things. The Tao is great. The universe is great. Earth is great. Man is great. These are the four great powers. Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao. The Tao follows only itself.

--

A great country is like the lower outlet of a river. It is the world's meeting ground, the world's female.

--

Treat the large as the small and the few as the many.

--

He does not struggle with anyone - thus no one can vanquish him.

--

The progress of the Way seems retreating.

--

Use the Light that dwells within you to regain your natural clarity of sight.

--

The usefulness of the pot lies in its emptiness.

--

Those who know do not speak; Those who speak do not know. Stop up the openings, Close down the doors, Rub off the sharp edges. Unravel all confusion. Harmonize the light, Give up contention: This is called finding the unity of life.

--

He who is able to conquer others is powerful; he who is able to conquer himself is more powerful.

--

The True Person benefits yet expects no reward, does the work and moves on. There is no desire to be considered better than others.

--

What has no substance can penetrate what has no opening.

--

Those who have hardened, have a covenant with Death. Those who remain gentle are conjoined with Life.

--

Pride attaches undue importance to the superiority of one's status in the eyes of others; and shame is fear of humiliation at one's inferior status in the estimation of others. When one sets one's heart on being highly esteemed, and achieves such rating, then he or she is automatically involved in fear of losing status.

--

When everyone in the world sees beauty, then ugly exists.

--

Hold on to the great image, and the whole world follows, follows unharmed, content and completely at peace.

--

Who is unhappy with little, won't be with much; who doesn't appreciate the small won't be able to take care of the large; who doesn't have enough with enough is at the margin or virtue, for the physical body lives from one day to another and if it gets what it really needs, there will be time for meditation, as long as if we try to give it everything it desires, endless will be the task.

--

Simplicity, patience, compassion.
These three are your greatest treasures.
Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being.
Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are.
Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.

--

Gain or loss, what is worse?

--

If you attach yourself to gross energies - loving this person, hating that clan, rejecting one experience or habitually indulging in another - then you will lead a series of heavy, attached lives. This can go on for a very long and tedious time.

--

Is not the action of nature like the stretching of a bow? The high, it pulls down; the low, it lifts up; It takes from what is in excess In order to make good of what is deficient. Who can take what they have in excess and offer it to others?

--

Who has excess and supplies the world? Only the one who follows the Way.

--

Man is ruled by Earth. Earth is ruled by Heaven. Heaven is ruled by the Way. The Way is ruled by itself.

--

Seek not happiness too greedily and be not fearful of happiness.

--

The ego is entranced by ... names and ideas... However names and concepts only block your perception of this Great Oneness. Therefore it is wise to ignore them. Those who live inside their egos are continually bewildered.

--

A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants.

--

To know people is wisdom, but to know yourself is enlightenment. to master people takes force, but to master yourself takes strength. to know contentment is wealth, and to live with strength resolve. to never leave whatever you are is to abide, and to die without getting lost- that is to live on and on.

--

Solve it before it happens. Order it before chaos emerges.

--

True power is stillness within motion.

--

Speaking with kindness creates confidence, thinking with kindness creates profoundness, giving with kindness creates love.

--

There is no greater mistake than to make light of an enemy By making light of an enemy many a kingdom has been lost.

--

When you extend your goodwill in every direction, regardless of circumstances, you begin to see that we are all one.

--

The sage does not attempt anything very big, and thus achieves greatness.

--

With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour.

--

Those who are self-righteous are not prominent.

--

Be still. Stillness reveals the secrets of eternity.

--

The Tao of the sage is work without effort.

--

Few things under heaven bring more benefit than the lessons learned from silence and the actions taken without striving.

--

Nature does not have to insist.

--

Why did the ancients praise the Way? Did they not say it was because you find what you seek and are saved from your wrongdoings?

--

I have three precious things which I hold fast and prize. The first is gentleness; the second frugality; the third is humility, which keeps me from putting myself before others. Be gentle and you can be bold; be frugal and you can be liberal; avoid putting yourself before others and you can become a leader among men.

--

What honor can there be without humility? What heights can be reached without being low? The pieces of a chariot are useless unless the work in accordance with the whole A man's life brings nothing unless he lives in accordance with the whole universe Playing one's part in accordance with the universe is true humility So whether you're a gem in the royal court or a stone on the common path If you accept your part with humility the glory of the universe will be yours.

--

Cut out doors and windows for the house. The holes make it useful.

--

...the more you talk of it, the less you understand.

--

To produce things and to rear them,
To produce, but not to take possession of them,
To act, but not to rely on one's own ability,
To lead them, but not to master them -
This is called profound and secret virtue.

--

Good Government is not intrusive the people are hardly aware of it; the next best is felt yet loved; then comes that which is known and feared; the worst government is hated.

--

Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking.

--

The reason why the universe is eternal is that it does not live for itself; it gives life to others as it transforms.

--

Eliminate mental muddiness and obscurity; keep your mind crystal clear. Allow your pure original insight to emerge. Quiet your emotions and abide in serenity. Don't go crazy with the worship of idols, images, and ideas; this is like putting a new head on top of the head you already have. Remember: if you can cease all restless activity, your integral nature will appear.

--

The feminine values are the fountain of bliss. Know the masculine, Keep to the feminine.

--

When good thing are accomplished, it does not claim (or name) them. This is Te, which is close in meaning to power or virtue. It is something within a person, and it is enhanced by following the Tao, or 'that from which nothing can deviate'.

--

Most of the world's religions serve only to strengthen attachments to false concepts such as self and other, life and death, heaven and earth, and so on. Those who become entangled in these false ideas are prevented from perceiving the Integral Oneness.

--

Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results.

--

Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.

--

The whole world says that my Way is great like nothing else. It is great because it is like nothing else. If it were like everything else, it would long ago have become insignificant.

--

We are all capable of much more than we think we are.

--

The more weapons of violence, the more misery to mankind. The triumph of violence ends in a festival of mourning.

--

The Great Tao flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, all things depend on it to exist, and it does not abandon them. To its accomplishments it lays no claims. It loves and nourished all things, but does not lord it over them.

--

Weapons are ominous tools. They are not the noble ruler's tools. He only uses them when he can't avoid it.

--

Those who know when to halt are unharmed.

--

The Way is the source of all things, good people's treasure and bad people's refuge.

--

Mastering others is strength. Mastering oneself makes you fearless.

--

When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors. When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities. There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy. Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.

--

Profound virtue is indeed deep and wide. It leads all things back to the great order.

--

In lightness the root is lost. In haste the ruler is lost.

--

The Master acts without doing, and everything gets done.

--

Why is the sea king of a hundred streams? Because it lies below them... If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility. If he would lead them, he must follow behind. In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed.

--

When the highest type of people hear Tao (Truth), they diligently practice it. When the average type of people hear Tao, they half believe in it. When the lowest type of people hear Tao, they laugh at it. If they did not laugh, it would not be Tao.

--

The one who can dissolve her mind will suddenly discover the Tao at her feet.

--

To lead people, walk beside them ... As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence. The next best, the people honor and praise. The next, the people fear; and the next, the people hate ... When the best leader's work is done the people say, 'We did it ourselves!

--

Because every portion of the body, mind, and spirit yearns for the integration of yin and yang, angelic intercourse is led by the spirit rather than the sexual organs. . . . Where ordinary intercourse unites sex organs with sex organs, angelic cultivation unites spirit with spirit, mind with mind, and every cell of one body with every cell of the other body.

--

If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself, if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.

--

Though (the Tao) is uncreated itself, it creates all things. Because it has no substance, it can enter into where there is no space. Exercising by returning to itself, winning victories by remaining gentle and yielding, it is softer than anything, and therefore overcomes everything hard.

--

Those who have compassion when they do battle will be victorious. Those who likewise defend themselves will be safe. Heaven will rescue and protect them with compassion.

--

The best way to manage anything is by making use of its own nature.

--

The reality of the building does not consist in the roof and walls, but in the space within to be lived in.

--

All men desire to free themselves solely from death; they do not know how to free themselves from life.

--

Happiness perches on misery. Misery crouches beneath happiness.

--

People aren't against you; they are for themselves. The most dangerous risk of all - the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. He who conquers others is strong, he who conquers himself is mighty.

--

Let people take death seriously, and not travel far.

--

To rule by knowledge ravages the country.

--

Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.

--

The Master's power is like this. He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire. He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed. He is never disappointed; thus his spirit never grows old.

--

Deal with the small before it becomes large.

--

Be careful what you water your dreams with. Water them with worry and fear and you will produce weeds that choke the life from your dream. Water them with optimism and solutions and you will cultivate success. Always be on the lookout for ways to turn a problem into an opportunity for success. Always be on the lookout for ways to nurture your dream.

--

He who defends with love will be secure; Heaven will save him, and protect him with love.

--

Prepare while it's easy.

--

A good speaker does not stutter.

--

. . . the mind is desperate to fix the river {of events} in place: Possessed by ideas of the past, preoccupied with images of the future, it overlooks the plain truth of the moment.

--

When the student is ready the teacher will appear.

--

Success is as dangerous as failure. Hope is as hollow as fear.

--

Those who have the courage to dare will perish. Those who have the courage not to dare will live.

--

The wise person dines on something more subtle: He eats the understanding that the named was born from the unnamed, that all being flows from non-being, that the describable world emanates from an indescribable source.

--

Those who praise victory relish manslaughter. Those who relish manslaughter cannot reach their goals in the world.

--

Only he who does not seek to be ahead of others is capable of living in harmony with everyone.

--

The softest in the world surpasses the hardest in the world.

--

The highest benevolence acts without purpose.

--

The female always surpasses the male with stillness. In her stillness she is yielding.

--

When one gives whatever one can without restraint, the barriers of individuality break down. It no longer becomes possible to tell whether it is the student offering himself to the teacher, or the teacher offering herself to the student. One sees only two immaculate beings, reflecting one another like a pair of brilliant mirrors.

--

Excellent leaders of people lower themselves.

--

Hold on to the center and make up your mind to rejoice in this paradise called life.

--

Not praising the deserving prevents envy.

--

The wise leader settles for good work and then lets others have the floor.

--

The best people are like water, which benefits all things and does not compete with them. It stays in lowly places that others reject. This is why it is so similar to the Way.

--

He who stands on tiptoe 
doesn't stand firm. 
He who rushes ahead 
doesn't go far. 
He who tries to shine 
dims his own light. 
He who defines himself 
can't know who he really is. 
He who has power over others 
can't empower himself. 
He who clings to his work 
will create nothing that endures.

--

Not knowing of the eternal leads to unfortunate errors.

--

By steadily disciplining the animal nature, until it becomes one pointed, it is possible to establish conscious awareness of The Eternal.

--

Covetousness is the greatest misfortune. One who does not know what is enough will never have enough.

--

By not claiming to be first in the world one can rule.

--

Kindness in words creates confidence.

--

Why are the people starving?-
Because their grain is being eaten up by the taxes
That's why they're starving

Why are people rebellious?-
Because those above them meddle in their lives
That's why they're rebellious

Why do people regard death so lightly?-
Because they are so involved with their own living
That's why they regard death so lightly

In the end,
The treasure of life is missed by those who hold on
and gained by those who let go.

--

Follow diligently the Way in your own heart, but make no display of it to the world.

--

I am wearied, as if I lacked a home to go to.

--

The Way to Heaven has no favorites. It is always with the good man.

--

These possessions of a simpleton being the three I choose and cherish: to care, to be fair, to be humble.

--

The transformation toward eternal life is gradual. The heavy gross energy of body, mind, and spirit must first be purified and uplifted. When the energy ascends... then self mastery can be sought.

--

Weapons are the tools of violence;all decent men detest them.Weapons are the tools of fear;a decent man will avoid themexcept in the direst necessityand, if compelled, will use themonly with the utmost restraint.Peace is his highest value.If the peace has been shattered,how can he be content?His enemies are not demons,but human beings like himself.He doesn't wish them personal harm.Nor does he rejoice in victory.How could he rejoice in victoryand delight in the slaughter of men?He enters a battle gravely,with sorrow and with great compassion,as if he were attending a funeral.

--

Stay at the center and let all things take their course.

--

The Tao is unpredictable to those that live according to plans. Only those who have no agenda are in harmony with the Tao.

--

Learn to lead in a nourishing manner. 
Learn to lead without being possessive. 
Learn to be helpful without taking the credit. 
Learn to lead without coercion.

--

The more laws and orders are multiplied, the more theft and violence increase.

--

Carrying body and soul and embracing the one, Can you avoid separation?

--

He who gains a victory over other men is strong; but he who gains a victory over himself is all powerful.

--

The most straight seems curved.

--

All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power.

--

The longer you travel, the less you know.

--

The way to use life is to do nothing through acting, The way to use life is to do everything through being.

--

The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be. Try to make people moral, and you lay the groundwork for vice.

--

There is no greater fault than sensual indulgence. There is no greater misfortune than malcontent. There is no greater calamity than greed.

--

A follower of the Way (Tao) loses something each day. Loss after loss until arriving at Non Action (Wu Wei).

--

Nothing and no one in the world is valuable or worthless.

--

When much virtue is achieved, nothing is not overcome.

--

The reason for great distress is the body. Without it, what distress could there be?

--

Even the longest journey must begin where you stand.

--

How do I become still?
By flowing with the stream.

--

Face the simple fact before it comes involved. Solve the small problem before it becomes big.

--

The fish cannot leave the deep waters. The state's weaponry should not be displayed.

--

For all things difficult to acquire, the intelligent man works with perseverance.

--

Take care of what is difficult while it is still easy, and deal with what will become big while it is yet small.

--

The sage knows himself, but does not parade. He cherishes himself, but does not praise himself.

--

The noble must make humility his root.

--

Those who show off do not shine.

--

The virtuous carry out the settlement, but those without virtue pursue their claims.

--

Regardless of how you feel inside, always try to look like a winner. Even if you are behind, a sustained look of control and confidence can give you a mental edge that results in victory. - Diane Arbus By letting it go it all gets done. The world is won by those who let it go. But when you try and try. The world is beyond the winning.

--

When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

--

Close your mouth,
block off your senses,
blunt your sharpness,
untie your knots,
soften your glare,
settle your dust.
This is the primal identity.

--

Do nondoing, strive for nonstriving, savor the flavorless, regard the small as important, make much of little, repay enmity with virtue; plan for difficulty when it is still easy, do the great while it is still small. The most difficult things in the world must be done while they are easy; the greatest things in the world must be done while they are small.

--

(The Tao) is always present and always available. . . . If you are willing to be lived by it, you will see it everywhere, even in the most ordinary things.

--

Whoever is capable of knowing when they have had enough will always be satisfied.

--

The truly great ones rely on substance, and not on surface, hold on to the fruit, and not to the flower.

--

When men lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster.

--

When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating.

--

The Way of Heaven does not complete, and yet it skillfully achieves victory. It does not speak, and yet it skillfully responds to things. It comes to you without your invitation.

--

What is a good man but a bad man's teacher? What is a bad man but a good man's job? If you do not remember this, You will get lost, No matter how intelligent you are. It is the great secret.

--

The wise does not think that only he is right -thus he knows the truth.

--

Those who boast are not respected.

--

Thus it is that "Some things are increased by being diminished, others are diminished by being increased." What others have taught, I also teach; verily, I will make it the root of my teaching.

--

I alone have the mind of a fool, and am all muddled and vague. The people are so smart and bright. While I am just dull and confused.

--

Things are not worth attending to, yet they have to be attended to.

--

Some have lavish garments, carry sharp swords, and feast on food and drink. They possess more than they can spend. This is called the vanity of robbers. It is certainly not the Way.

--

Those who are one with deprivation are deprived of deprivation.

--

A good door needs no lock, still it can't be opened.

--

Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.

--

Can you dissolve your ego? Can you abandon the idea of self and other? Can you relinquish the notions of male and female, short and long, life and death? Can you let go of all these dualities and embrace the Tao without skepticism or panic? If so, you can reach the heart of the Integral Oneness.

--

The sage embraces the one, and is an example to the world.

--

If you want to know me, look inside your heart.

--

The master understands that the universe is forever out of control.

--

The Tao is told is not the Tao.

--

He who knows how to be aggressive, and yet remains patient, becomes a receptacle for all of Nature's lessons.

--

That the soft overcomes the hard, and the yielding overcomes the resistant, is a fact known by all, but practiced by few.

--

The best leaders are those their people hardly know exist.
The next best is a leader who is loved and praised.
Next comes the one who is feared.
The worst one is the leader that is despised ...
The best leaders value their words, and use them sparingly.
When they have accomplished their task,
the people say, "Amazing!
We did it, all by ourselves!

--

Leadership is your ability to hide your panic from others.

--

Understanding others is knowledge, Understanding oneself is enlightenment; Conquering others is power, Conquering oneself is strength.

--

People turn their eyes and ears to him (the sage), and the sage cares for them like his own children.

--

A tree as wide as a man's embrace grows from a tiny shoot.

--

The new life created by the final integration is self-aware yet without ego, capable of inhabiting a body yet not attached to it, and guided by wisdom rather than emotion. Whole and virtuous, it can never die.

--

By compassion one can be brave.

--

The group will not prosper if the leader grabs the lion's share of the credit for the good work that has been done.

--

If you scramble about in search of inner peace, you will lose your inner peace.

--

Being satisfied with little, you can gain much. Seeking much you will go astray. The wise heeds this precept. If it could be so with all people!

--

Failure is an opportunity. If you blame someone else, there is no end to the blame. Therefore the Master fulfills her own obligations and corrects her own mistakes. She does what she needs to do and demands nothing of others.

--

. . . Intelligence is not the same thing as wisdom.

--

Great talents ripen late; the highest notes are hard to hear.

--

Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner.

--

Free from desire, you realize the mystery, caught in the desire, you see only the manifestations.

--

The small is easy to scatter.

--

The world is a sacred vessel. It should not be meddled with. It should not be owned. If you try to meddle with it you will ruin it. If you try to own it you will lose it.

--

Make the small big and the few many.

--

Meet the big while it is small.

--

The best form of leadership is to be conscious of the leadership potential with the followers and to let them unleash this potential in a spontaneous way. When a great leader accomplishes this task with effortless ease, the followers say, "We did it ourselves."

--

A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants. A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is.

--

The Tao is great. The universe is great. Earth is great. Man is great. These are the four great powers. Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao. The Tao follows only itself.

--

Go to the people. Learn from them. Live with them. Start with what they know. Build with what they have. The best of leaders when the job is done, when the task is accomplished, the people will say we have done it ourselves.

--

The value comes from what is there, but the use comes from what is not there.

--

The moment truth is asserted, it becomes false.

--

{The cleansing of spiritual contamination} is accomplished by offering one's talent, resources, and life to the world.

--

He who is attached to things will suffer much.

--

Pounding an edge to sharpness will not make it last.

--

Therefore the Sage embraces Unity, and is a model for all under Heaven. He is free from self-display, therefore he shines forth; from self-assertion, therefore he is distinguished; from self-glorification, therefore he has merit; from self-exaltation, therefore he rises superior to all. Inasmuch as he does not strive, there is no one in the world who can strive with him.

--

Thirty spokes meet in the hub. Where a wheel isn't is where it's useful. Hollowed out, clay makes a pot. Where the pots not is where it's useful. Cut doors and windows to make a room. Where the room isn't, there's room for you. So the profit in what is, is in the use of what isn't.

--

Peace is our natural state of being.

--

Health is the greatest possession.

--

The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao. When rich speculators prosper While farmers lose their land; when government officials spend money on weapons instead of cures; when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn- all this is robbery and chaos. It is not in keeping with the Tao.

--

Be still like a mountain and flow like a great river.

--

If you correct your mind the rest of your life will fall into place.

--

Without going out-of-doors, one can know all he needs to know. Without even looking out of his window, one can grasp the nature of everything. Without going beyond his own nature, one can achieve ultimate wisdom. Therefore, the intelligent man knows all he needs to know without going away, And sees all he needs to see without looking elsewhere, And does all he needs to do wihout undue exertion.

--

When the worst student hears about the Way, he laughs out loud. If he did not laugh, it would be unworthy of being the Way.

--

Prepare for the difficult while it is still easy. Deal with the big while it is still small. Difficult undertakings have always started with what easy. Great undertakings always started with what is small. Therefore the sage never strives for the great,And thereby the great is achieved.

--

The reason why rivers and seas are able to be lords over a hundred mountain streams, is that they know how to keep below them. That is why they are able to reign over all the mountain streams.

--

The Way that can be walked is not the eternal Way.

--

Find a teacher who is an integral being, a beacon who extends his light and virtue with equal ease to those who appreciate him and those who don't. Shape yourself in his mold, bathe in his nourishing radiance, and reflect it out to the rest of the world.

--

He does not praise himself - yet he is respectable.

--

He who has no faith in others shall find no faith in them.

--

Truly, only those who see illness as illness can avoid illness.

--

Do not imagine that an integral being has the ambition of enlightening the unaware or raising worldly people to the divine realm. To her, there is no self and other, and hence no one to be raised; no heaven and hell, and hence no destination.

--

Water is the softest thing, yet it can penetrate mountains and earth. This shows clearly the principle of softness overcoming hardness.

--

The sage never strives for the great, and thereby the great is achieved.

--

If you would take, you must first give.

--

Take care with the end as you do with the beginning.

--

Let people return to making knots on ropes, instead of writing.

--

He who is great must make humility his base. He who is high must make lowliness his foundation. Thus, princes and kings in speaking of themselves use the terms "lonely," "friendless," "of small account." Is not this making humility their base?

--

To lead, one must follow.

--

People who have to fight for their living and are not afraid to die for it are higher persons than those who, stationed high, are too fat to dare to die.

--

Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.

--

There are many paths to enlightenment. Be sure to take the one with a heart.

--

There is nothing softer and weaker than water, and yet there is nothing better for attacking hard and strong things.

--

How do I know about the world? By what is within me.

--

When the world is ruled according to the Way, the ghosts lose their power. The ghosts do not really lose their power, but it is not used to harm people.

--

Just as the value of a house lies in its location, The value of a mind lies in its depth, The value of giving lies in the presence of a generous spirit, The value of words lies in their reliability.

--

Why do the people think so little of death?
Because the rulers demand too much of life. 
Therefore the people take death lightly.

--

As soon as rules were made, names were given. There are already many names. One must know when it is enough.

--

Keep behind, and you shall be put in front; keep out, and you shall be kept in.

--

Who can enjoy enlightenment and remain indifferent to suffering in the world? This is not in keeping with the Way. Only those who increase their service along with their understanding can be called men and women of Tao.

--

You will understand a great truth when you get to realize that what you do to others, you are doing to yourself.

--

True words aren't eloquent; eloquent words aren't true. Wise men don't need to prove their point; men who need to prove their point aren't wise. The Master has no possessions. The more he does for others, the happier he is. The more he gives to others, the wealthier he is. The Tao nourishes by not forcing. By not dominating, the Master leads.

--

Do not look only at yourself, and you will see much. Do not justify yourself, and you will be distinguished. Do not brag, and you will have merit. Do not be prideful, and your work will endure.

--

Use justice to rule a country. Use surprise to wage war. Use non-action to govern the world.

--

Therefore: In dwelling, choose modest quarters, in thinking, value stillness, in dealing with others, be kind, in choosing words, be sincere, in leading, be just, in working, be competent, in acting, choose the correct timing. Follow these words and there will be no error.

--

Only by working within the laws that govern the flow of water will happiness be achieved.

--

Embrace simplicity. Put others first. Desire little.

--

A man's excellence is like that of water; It benefits all things without striving; It takes to the low places shunned by men. Water is akin to Tao. . . . In all the earth nothing weaker than water, Yet in attacking the hard, nothing superior, Nothing so certain in wearing down strength: There is no way to resist it. Note then: The weak conquer the strong, The yielding outlast the aggressors.

--

Distortion upon distortion: . . . the more one uses the mind, the more confused one becomes.

--

Without stepping out the door, you can know the world.

--

Develop the strength of a man, but live as gently as a woman.

--

Arms are instruments of ill omen.... When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish. There is no glory in victory, and to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men.... When great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow. When victorious in war, one should observe mourning rites.

--

Simple, like uncarved wood.

--

The purpose of life is the investigation of the Sun, the Moon, and the heavens.

--

Though tightly the net of words forms, how surely truth slips out.

--

Without the tao, Kindness and compassion are replaced by law and justice; Faith and trust are supplanted by ritual and ceremony.

--

What is and what is not create each other.

--

Understand this if nothing else: spiritual freedom and oneness with the Tao are not randomly bestowed gifts, but the rewards of conscious self-transformation and self-evolution.

--

Those who advice the ruler on the Way, do not want the world subdued with weapons.

--

It (Tao) is eternally without desire. So, it can be called small. All things return to it, although it does not make itself their ruler. So, it can be called great.

--

The leader is best, When people are hardly aware of his existence, Not so good when people praise his government, Less good when people stand in fear, Worst, when people are contemptuous. Fail to honor people, and they will fail to honor you. But of a good leader, who speaks little, When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, The people say, 'We did it ourselves.'

--

Can you make your soul embrace the One and not lose it?

--

The Way is ever without action, yet nothing is left undone.

--

Watch your thoughts, they become words.

--

Those who know it do not speak about it. Those who speak about it do not know it.

--

Stop thinking, and end your problems. What difference between yes and no? What difference between success and failure? Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous!

--

Abandon wisdom, discard knowledge, and people will benefit a hundredfold.

--

All action begins in rest... This is the ultimate truth.

--

Take time to listen to what is said without words, to obey the law too subtle to be written, to worship the unnameable and to embrace the unformed.

--

Stop trying to control. Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself.

--

The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth.

--

The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of all things.

--

Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools. He uses them only when he has no choice.

--

He who hoards much loses much.

--

A man is born gentle and weak. At death he is hard and stiff.

--

Deal with difficult tasks while they are easy. Act on large issues while they are small.

--

The one who does not stray away from her/his nature will live long.

--

That which is achieved the most, still has the whole of its future yet to be achieved.

--

The light of the Way seems dim.

--

Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.

--

To bear the country's disgrace is to rule the shrines of soil and grain. To bear the country's misfortunes is to be the king of the world.

--

Keep your mouth shut, and close up the doors of sight and sound, and as long as you live you will have no vexation. But open your mouth, or become inquisitive, and you will be in trouble all your life long.

--

Other people have more than they need, I alone seem wanting.

--

When taxes are too high, people go hungry.

--

To be of few words is natural.

--

Rule a kingdom as though you were cooking a small fish - don't overdo it.

--

Those who understand others are clever, those who understand themselves are wise.

--

Knowing the bright, but clinging to the dark, you become a model to the world.

--

When the sage stands above people, they are not oppressed. When he leads people, they are not obstructed. The world will exalt him and not grow tired of him.

--

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

--

By moderation one can be generous.

--

Lightly given promises must meet with little trust.

--

Practice non-action. Work without doing.

--

When you are one with loss, the loss is experienced willingly.

--

Whatever is flexible and living will tend to grow; whatever is rigid and blocked will wither and die.

--

In the Universe the difficult things are done as if they were easy.

--

Mask your brightness. Be at one with the dust of the earth. This is primal union.

--

The surest test if a person be sane, is if she accepts life whole, as it is.

--

The one who is conscious (in Tao) can't speak. The one who can speak is not conscious (centered in Tao)

--

To know you have enough is to be rich.

--

The superior student listens to the Way and follows it closely. The average student listens to the Way and follows some and some not. The lesser student listens to the Way and laughs out loud. If there were no laughter it would not be the Way.

--

Why not simply honor your parents, love your children, help your brothers and sisters, be faithful to your friends, care for your mate with devotion, complete your work cooperatively and joyfully, assume responsibility for problems, practice virtue without first demanding it of others, understand the highest truths yet retain an ordinary manner? That would be true clarity, true simplicity, true mastery.

--

Time is a created thing. To say 'I don't have time' is to say 'I don't want to.'

--

Know the white, But keep the black, Be an example to the world! Being an example to the world, Ever true and unwavering, Return to the infinite.

--

The master accomplishes more and more by doing less and less until finally he accomplishes everything by doing nothing.

--

He does not feel pity for himself - thus he can successfully develop.

--

Much knowledge will corrupt the heart,/When partly understood,/And so the people grow too smart,/But neither wise nor good.

--

If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never be truly fulfilled.

--

The sage has no concern for himself, but makes the concerns of others his own.

--

To know that you do not know is the best. To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease.

--

Without going outside, you may know the whole world, without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. Thus the sage knows without traveling; he sees without looking; he works without doing.

--

When people see some things as good, other things become bad.

--

In work, do what you enjoy.

--

Free from desire, you realize the mystery.

--

Build up virtue, and you master all.

--

The generals have a saying: "Rather than make the first move it is better to wait and see. Rather than advance an inch it is better to retreat a yard." This is called going forward without advancing, pushing back without using weapons. There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy means thinking that he is evil. Thus you destroy your three treasures and become an enemy yourself. When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.

--

With virtue and quietness one may conquer the world.

--

The Tao is like a well; used but never used up.

--

Perfect kindness acts without thinking of kindness.

--

Be who you are, and go the whole way.

--

The farther you go, the less you know.

--

The great Way is very straight, but people prefer to deviate.

--

The sage does not hoard. The more he helps others, the more he benefits himself, Having bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more; having given all he has to others, he is richer still.

--

No weapon is sharper than will.

--

In ancient times, people said that imperfect moves to becoming perfect. Are these words vain? No! Truly, by gaining Unity you come to Perfection!

--

That so few understand me is why I am treasured.

--

Lessen selfishness and restrain desires.

--

There is no illusion great than fear.

--

As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excess and deficiency so that there is perfect balance.

--

I have no desire to desire, and people become like the uncarved wood by themselves.

--

Kindness in thinking creates profoundness.

--

Can you be still and look inside?If so, then you know the truth is always available, and always responsive.

--

Your own positive future begins in this moment. All you have is right now. Every goal is possible from here.

--

Not-knowing is true knowledge. 
Presuming to know is a disease.
First realize that you are sick;
then you can move toward health.

--

If you can let go of (the Tao) with your mind and surround it with your heart, it will live inside you forever.

--

Sometimes gain comes from losing, and sometimes loss comes from gaining.

--

If you are at peace, you are living in the present.

--

I do not know its name. I call it the Way. For the lack of better words I call it great.

--

First and last follow each other.

--

Truly, only acting without thought of one's life is superior to valuing one's life.

--

Lay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult; make something big by starting with it when small.

--

The Way is ever nameless.

--

Learn from the people. Plan with the people. Begin with what they have. Build on what they know.

--

The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao The name that can be named is not the eternal Name. The unnamable is the eternally real. Naming is the origin of all particular things. Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source. This source is called darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding.

--

Abandon fancy theologies and imaginary ideas and do some ordinary daily work... {Engage in this work with} unswerving kindness and unending patience.

--

Approach your own inner life with a loving quality that accepts who you are without trying to change who you are.

--

Meandering leads to perfection.

--

Do you think that you can clear your mind by sitting constantly in silent meditation? This makes your mind narrow, not clear. Integral awareness is fluid and adaptable, present in all places and at all times. That is true meditation. ... The Tao is clear and simple, and it doesn't avoid the world.

--

When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, and dignified as a king. Immersed in wonder, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.

--

When the great Tao is forgotten, goodness and piety appear. When the body's intelligence declines, cleverness and knowledge step forth. When there is no peace in the family, filial piety begins. When the country falls into chaos, patriotism is born.

--

Those who know are not learned. Those who are learned do not know.

--

Be as the still mountain; Move like the great river.

--

To be learned, add something each day. To be enlightened drop something each day.

--

The valley spirit never dies. It is called the mystical female.

--

If good happens, good; if bad happens, good.

--

If you can find true contentment, it will last forever.

--

When goodness is lost, it is replaced by morality.

--

If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand. If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given. This is called the subtler perception of the way things are. The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast. Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results.

--

The most difficult in the world must be easy in its beginning.

--

Weapons are ominous tools. They are abhorred by all creatures. Anyone who follows the Way shuns them.

--

Always be on the lookout for ways to turn a problem into an opportunity for success. Always be on the lookout for ways to nurture your dream.

--

There is no greater crime than desire.

--

If you worry more for others' beliefs, then you will be their slave.

--

The greatest virtue is to follow the Way utterly.

--

Excellent soldiers are not furious.

--

Words have divided man from woman,
one from another, this from that,
until only sages know how to put things together.
Without words, without even understanding,
lovers find each other.
The moment of finding is always a surprise,
like meeting an old friend never before known.

--

Where there is no conflict, there is no fault.

--

Knowing that you do not know is the best. Not knowing that you do not know is an illness.

--

Movement overcomes cold.

--

First, we must do our own personal work, then we tend the necessary work of our family, then our community, then the world.

--

He who overcomes others has force; he who overcomes himself is strong.

--

Justice has long arm.

--

He does not seek power - yet people follow him.

--

Good walking leaves no track behind it.

--

True perfection seems imperfect,
yet it is perfectly itself.
True fullness seems empty,
yet it is fully present.
True straightness seems crooked.
True wisdom seems foolish.
True art seems artless.
The Master allows things to happen.
She shapes events as they come.
She steps out of the way
and lets the Tao speak for itself.

--

Simplicity has no name is free of desires. Being free of desires it is tranquil. And the world will be at peace of it's own accord.

--

No misfortune is worse than underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy, I risk losing my treasure.

--

Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force.

--

He who knows he has enough is rich.

--

Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it. The soft overcomes the hard; the gentle overcomes the rigid. Everyone knows this is true, but few can put it into practice. Therefore the Master remains serene in the midst of sorrow. Evil cannot enter his heart. Because he has given up helping, he is people's greatest help. True words seem paradoxical.

--

High and low rest on each other.

--

Going forward seems like retreat.

--

There is something obscure which is complete before heaven and earth arose; tranquil, quiet, standing alone without change, moving without peril. It could be the mother of everything. Not knowing its name, I call it Tao.

--

He who knows enough is enough will always have enough.

--

We go from birth to death. Three out of ten follow life. Three out of ten follow death. People who rush from birth to death are also three out of ten. Why is that so? Because they want to make too much of life.

--

Those who stay where they are will endure.

--

The Way to do is to be.

--

A good traveler leaves no tracks. Good speech lacks fault-finding.

--

If you want to be given everything, give everything up.

--

Wise travelers always stop short before they come to danger.

--

Know honor, Yet keep humility. Be the valley of the universe! Being the valley of the universe, Ever true and resourceful, Return to the state of the uncarved block.

--

The grandest virtue seems deficient.

--

One who believes in himself has no need to convince others.

--

He who treasures his body as much as the world can care for the world.

--

The highest tone is hard to hear.

--

The good man is the teacher of the bad, And the bad is the material from which the good may learn. He who does not value the teacher, Or greatly care for the material, Is greatly deluded although he may be learned. Such is the essential mystery.

--

Fine words are traded. Noble deeds gain respect. But people who are not good, why abandon them?

--

The liberation cannot be reached but by means of the perception of the identity of the individual spirit with the universal spirit.

--

All things such as grass and trees are soft and supple in life. At their death they are withered and dry.

--

For knowledge, add something every day. For wisdom....subtract.

--

Great, it passes on (in constant flow).

--

Heavy is the root of light.

--

Knowing the future is the flower of the Way, and the beginning of folly.

--

Confidence is the greatest friend.

--

Empty your mind of all thoughts.

--

I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes as common as the grass.

--

From What-is all the world of things was born But What-is sprang in turn from What-is-not.

--

What's the difference between yes and no?

--

Let the country be small, and the inhabitants few.

--

Throw away holiness and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times happier. Throw away morality and justice, and people will do the right thing. Throw away industry and profit, and there won't be any thieves. If these three aren't enough, just stay at the center of the circle and let all things take their course.

--

Supreme good is like water. Water greatly benefits all things, without conflict. It flows through places that people loathe. Thereby it is close to the Way.

--

Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle. A tree that is unbending is easily broken.

--

Appetite for food and sex is nature.

--

No thought, no action, no movement, total stillness: only thus can one manifest the true nature and law of things from within and unconsciously, and at last become one with heaven and earth.

--

The truth often sounds paradoxical.

--

Can you deal with the most vital matters by letting events take their course? Can you step back from you own mind and thus understand all things? Giving birth and nourishing, having without possessing, acting with no expectations, leading and not trying to control: this is the supreme virtue.

--

It is better not to make merit a matter of reward Lest people conspire and contend.

--

Only fools seek power, and the greatest fools seek it through force.

--

The tree which needs two arms to span its girth sprang from the tiniest shoot. Yon tower, nine stories high, rose from a little mound of earth. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

--

I am at peace, and people become fair by themselves.

--

If you want to become full, let yourself be empty.

--

Knowing others is to be clever. Knowing yourself is to be enlightened. Overcoming others requires force. Overcoming yourself requires strength.

--

To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom.

--

Weapons are not proper instruments for gentle people; they use them only when they have no other choice. Peace and quiet are what they value. They do not glory in victory.

--

Be content with an ordinary life.

--

Watch your thoughts, they become words. Watch your words, they become actions. Watch your actions, they become habit.

--

My own words are not the medicine, but a prescription; not the destination, but a map to help you reach it. When you get there, quiet your mind and close your mouth. Don't analyze the Tao. Strive instead to live it: silently, undividedly, with your whole harmonious being.

--

Racing through the field and hunting make the mind wild.

--

The world's beginning is its mother. To have found the mother is also to know the children. Although you know the children, cling to the mother. Until your last day you will not be harmed.

--

The most complete seems lacking. Yet in use it is not exhausted.

--

The Tao is infinite, eternal. Why is it eternal? It was never born; thus it can never die. Why is it infinite? It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings. The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead. She is detached from all things; that is why she is one with them. Because she has let go of herself, she is perfectly fulfilled.

--

The difficult problems in life always start off being simple. Great affairs always start off being small.

--

Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another paradox: what is soft is strong.

--

The things that have acquired unity are these: Heaven by unity has become clear; Earth by unity has become steady; The Spirit by unity has become spiritual; The Valley by unity has become full; All things by unity have come into existence.

--

My words are easy to understand and easy to perform,
Yet no man under heaven knows them or practices them.

--

My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practice; but there is no one in the world who is able to understand and practice them.

--

If I have even just a little sense, I will walk on the main road and my only fear will be of straying from it. Keeping to the main road is easy, But people love to be sidetracked.

--

Praise leads to weakness. Getting it causes fear, losing it causes fear.

--

Letting the mind control the vital breath is called force.

--

Before healing others, heal yourself.

--

If I have just an ounce of sense, I follow the great Way, and fear only to stray from it.

--

Those who act will fail. Those who seize will lose.

--

When superior people hear of the Way, they carry it out with diligence. When middling people hear of the Way, it sometimes seems to be there, sometimes not. When lesser people hear of the Way, they ridicule it greatly. If they didn't laugh at it, it wouldn't be the Way.

--

The sage does not strive to be great. Thereby he can accomplish the great.

--

Who can rest until the moment of action?

--

When you stand with your two feet on the ground, you will always keep your balance.

--

Greed for enlightenment and immortality is no different than greed for material wealth. It is self-centered and dualistic, and thus an obstacle to true attainment. Therefore these states are never achieved by those who covet them; rather, they are the reward of the virtuous.

--

Do nondoing, strive for non-stiving, savor the flavourless, make much of little, repay enmity with virture; plan for difficulty when it is still easy, do the great while it is still small.

--

If one desires to receive one must first give. This is called profound understanding.

--

Instead of being afraid of death, we should try to awake to life; and the only death we should escape from is to forget the presence of God into us.

--

Marriage is three parts love and seven parts forgiveness of sins.

--

Without going outside, you may know the whole world!

--

Do not strive for the shine of jade, but clatter like stone.

--

A good athlete can enter a state of body-awareness in which the right stroke or the right movement happens by itself, effortlessly, without any interference of the conscious will. This is a paradigm for non-action: the purest and most effective form of action. The game plays the game; the poem writes the poem; we can't tell the dancer from the dance. It happens when we trust the intelligence of the universe in the same way that an athlete or a dancer trusts the superior intelligence of the body.

--

By the accident of fortune a man may rule the world for a time, but by virtue of love and kindness he may rule the world forever.

--

Gentleness brings victory to him who attacks, and safety to him who defends. Those whom Heaven would save, it fences round with gentleness.

--

Creating without claiming, Doing without taking credit, Guiding without interfering, This is Primal Virtue.

--

All things of the world are born of being; being is born of nonbeing.

--

Water does not force its way.

--

Loving, hating, having expectations: all these are attachments. Attachment prevents the growth of one's true being.

--

Become totally empty 
Quiet the restlessness of the mind 
Only then will you witness everything unfolding from emptiness

--

Whoever is planted in the Tao will not be rooted up. Whoever embraces the Tao will not slip away. Her name will be held in honor from generation to generation. Let the Tao be present in your life and you will become genuine. Let it be present in your family and your family will flourish. Let it be present in your country and your country will be an example to all countries in the world. Let it be present in the universe and the universe will sing. How do I know this is true? By looking inside myself.

--

Knowing honor, but clinging to disgrace, you become the valley of the world.

--

In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In daily life, be competent. In action, be aware of the time and the season.

--

Be gentle and you can be bold; be frugal and you can be liberal; avoid putting yourself before others and you can become a leader among men.

--

What makes a kingdom great is its being like a down-flowing river,--the central point towards which all the smaller streams under Heaven converge; or like the female throughout the world, who by quiescence always overcomes the male. And quiescence is a form of humility.

--

True words seem false.

--

The best fighter is never angry.

--

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind; Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily; Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness; Sometimes one is up and sometimes down. Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.

--

Realize thy Simple Self, Embrace thy Original Nature.

--

Everything in the universe is created from something, which in turn is created from nothing.

--

Fail to honor people, they fail to honor you.

--

He does not seek glory - yet people respect him.

--

Countless words 
count less 
than the silent balance 
between yin and yang

--

Those who are content suffer no disgrace.

--

The best of all teachers is the one who helps people so that eventually they don't need him.

--

What people loathe the most is to be orphaned, desolate, unworthy. But this is what princes and kings call themselves.

--

The one who rules like the mother lasts long.

--

Practice not-doing and everything will fall into place.

--

When you have accomplished your goal simply walk away. This is the path way to Heaven.

--

He who has achieved this state Is unconcerned with friends and enemies, With good and harm, with honor and disgrace. This therefore is the highest state of man.

--

Peacefulness is an inner sense of calm - it comes from becoming still - in order to reflect and meditate on our inner wisdom and receive answers. A peaceful heart is one that is free from worry and rouble. It's becoming quiet so we can look at things quietly so we can more clearly understand them and thus come up with creative solutions. It is learning to live in the present. Freedom from desire leads to inner peace.

--

The wise trusts not only to his physical eyes - thus he can see clearly.

--

If people are not afraid of dying, why threaten them with death?

--

What's the difference between beautiful and ugly?

--

Try to change it and you will ruin it. Try to hold it and you will lose it.

--

Because he is a living divinity, when he acts, the universe acts.

--

There is a time to go ahead and a time to stay behind. There is a time to breathe easy and time to breathe hard. There is a time to be vigorous and a time to be gentle. There is a time to gather and a time to release. Can you see things as they are And let them be all on their own?

--

Allow your softer, more intuitive, and less dominating feminine qualities to rise to the fore, so that you're surrendering rather than dominating, receiving rather than broadcasting, loving rather than fighting.

--

Pain and happiness are simply conditions of the ego. Forget the ego.

--

Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench. Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner. Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity.

--

Use the light to return to clarity.

--

When family ties are disturbed, devoted children arise.

--

The Way of Tao is this: It strives not, but conquers; It speaks not, but all is made clear; It summons not, but its house is crowded; It contrives not, but the design is perfect.

--

Good leaders reach solutions, and then stop. They do not dare to rely on force.

--

See simplicity in the complicated. Achieve greatness in little things.

--

To know and not to do is not yet to know.

--

When you accept yourself, the Universe accepts you.

--

Without desire there is stillness, and the world settles by itself.

--

If the majority doesn't laugh at you, beware that you must be saying something wrong. When the majority thinks you are a fool, only then is there some possibility of you being a wise man.

--

Act without expectation.

--

Those who know others are intelligent Those who know themselves have insight. Those who master others have force Those who master themselves have strength.Those who know what is enough are wealthy. Those who persevere have direction. Those who maintain their position endure. And those who die and yet do not perish, live on.

--

The sage is one with the world, and lives in harmony with it.

--

The Way is eternal. Until your last day, you are free from peril.

--

Every step is on the path.

--

Only those who leisurely approach that which the masses are busy about can be busy about that which the masses take leisurely.

--

If you really want everything, then give up everything.

--

The purest white seems stained.

--

Stop thinking, and end your problems.

--

When people see some things as beautiful, other things become ugly. When people see some things as good, other things become bad. Being and non-being create each other. Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. High and low depend on each other. Before and after follow each other. Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn't possess, acts but doesn't expect. When her work is done, she forgets it. That is why it lasts forever.

--

In ancient times, those who followed the Way did not try to give people knowledge thereof, but kept them ignorant.

--

Yet mystery and reality emerge from the same source.

--

The more laws that are written, the more criminals are produced.

--

The value of actions lies in their timing.

--

If there is to be peace in the world, 
There must be peace in the nations.
If there is to be peace in the nations, 
There must be peace in the cities.
If there is to be peace in the cities, 
There must be peace between neighbors.
If there is to be peace between neighbors, 
There must be peace in the home.
If there is to be peace in the home, 
There must be peace in the heart.

--

The more you know the less you understand.

--

As long as we have hope, we have direction, the energy to move, and the map to move by. We have a hundred alternatives, a thousand paths and an infinity of dreams. Hopeful, we are halfway to where we want to go; hopeless, we are lost forever.

--

If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you aren't afraid of dying, there is nothing you can't achieve. Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter's place. When you handle the master carpenter's tools, chances are that you'll cut your hand.

--

The wise man knows he doesn't know.

--

To know how little one knows is to have genuine knowledge. Not to know how little one knows is to be deluded. Only those who know when they are deluded can free themselves from such delusion. The intelligent people are not deluded, because they know and accept their ignorance as ignorance, and thereby have genuine knowledge.

--

A tree that can fill the span of a man's arms grows from a downy tip; A terrace nine stories high rises from level earth; A journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath one's feet.

--

Although there are weapons for tens and hundreds of soldiers, they will not be used.

--

It is wealth to be content.

--

Fame of self: Which matters more? Self or wealth: Which is more precious? Gain or loss: Which is more painful?

--

Always be on the lookout for ways to nurture your dream.

--

We desire to understand the world by giving names to the things we see, but these things are only the effects of something subtle.

--

You cannot know the body by studying the finger, and you cannot understand the universe by learning one science.

--

Hold on to the ancient Way to master the present, and to learn the distant beginning.

--

Those who seek knowledge, collect something every day. Those who seek the Way, let go of something every day.

--

Giving birth and nourishing, Bearing yet not possessing, Working yet not taking credit, Leading yet not dominating, This is the Primal Virtue.

--

Can you let go of words and ideas, attitudes and expectations? If so, then the Tao will loom into view.

--

Knowing others is wisdom; Knowing the self is enlightenment; Mastering others requires force; Mastering the self needs strength.

--

The wise man, after learning something new, is afraid to learn anything more until he has put his first lesson into practice.

--

For one gains by losing And loses by gaining.

--

Do you imagine the universe is agitated? Go into the desert at night and look out at the stars. This practice should answer the question..... The master settles her mind as the universe settles the stars in the sky. By connecting her mind with the subtle origin, she calms it. Once calmed, it naturally expands, and ultimately her mind becomes as vast and immeasurable as the night sky.

--

When there is no desire, all things are at peace.

--

When bitter enemies make peace, surely some bitterness remains.

--

To have enough of enough is always enough.

--

If you fail to honor your people, They will fail to honor you; It is said of a good leader that When the work is done, the aim fulfilled, The people will say, "We did this ourselves."

--

The way of heaven is to help and not harm.

--

Gently eliminating all obstacles to his own understanding, he constantly maintains his unconditional sincerity. His humility, perseverance, and adaptability evoke the response of the universe and fill him with divine light.

--

Tao is beyond words and beyond understanding. Words may be used to speak of it, but they cannot contain it. Tao existed before words and names, before heaven and earth, before the ten thousand things. It is the unlimited father and mother of all limited things. Therefore, to see beyond boundaries to the subtle heart of things, dispense with names, with concepts, with expectations and ambitions and differences. Tao and its many manifestations arise from the same source: subtle wonder within mysterious darkness. This is the beginning of all understanding.

--

If the sage wants to stand above people, he must speak to them from below. If he wants to lead people, he must follow them from behind.

--

The wise are not learned, the learned are not wise.

--

Going back to the origin is called peace; it means reversion to destiny. Reversion to destiny is called eternity. Those who know eternity are called enlightened.

--

The cords of passion and desire weave a binding net around you. Worldly confrontation makes you stiff and inflexible. The trap of duality is tenacious. Bound, rigid, and trapped, you cannot experience liberation.

--

By following this simple path, you become extraordinary, unfathomable, a being of profound cosmic subtlety. You outlive time and space by realizing the subtle truth of the universe.

--

Knowledge studies others, wisdom is self known.

--

Remember: if you can cease all restless activity, your integral nature will appear.

--

When leading people and serving Heaven, nothing exceeds moderation.

--

When merit has been achieved, do not take it to yourself; for if you do not take it to yourself, it shall never be taken from you.

--

Being is born of not being.

--

Behave simply and hold on to purity.

--

Praise of power leads to weakness; Love of things leads to loss; The wise one leads by filling people's hearts; He destroys illusion and disturbs those who believe they are wise; He does nothing yet everything happens.

--

Intellectual knowledge exists in and of the brain. Because the brain is part of the body, which must one day expire, this collection of facts, however large and impressive, will expire as well. {But spiritual insight transcends death.}

--

The Great Vessel takes long to complete.

--

Virtue in its grandest aspect is neither more nor less than following reason.

--

Be empty. Be still. Just watch everything come and go. This is the way of Nature.

--

A foolish man is always doing, Yet much remains to be done.

--

Look, and it can't be seen.
Listen, and it can't be heard.
Reach, and it can't be grasped.

Above, it isn't bright.
Below, it isn't dark.
Seamless, unnamable,
it returns to the realm of nothing.
Form that includes all forms,
image without an image,
subtle, beyond all conception.

Approach it and there is no beginning;
follow it and there is no end.
You can't know it, but you can be it,
at ease in your own life.
Just realize where you come from:
this is the essence of wisdom.

--

Being a model to the world, eternal virtue will never falter in you, and you return to the boundless.

--

Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.

--

If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.

--

Complete your task. Seek no reward. Make no claims. Without faltering fully choose to do what you must do.

--

There is no need to run outside for better seeing... Rather abide at the center of your being; For the more you leave it the less you learn. Search your heart and see... The way to do is to be.

--

It is wisdom to know others. It is enlightenment to know oneself.

There was something undifferentiated and yet complete, which existed before Heaven and Earth. Soundless and formless, it depends on nothing and does not change.
